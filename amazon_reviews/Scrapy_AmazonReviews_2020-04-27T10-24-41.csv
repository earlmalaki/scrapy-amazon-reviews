RNK3QQW4ZU726,"April 24, 2020",Sarah,4,MC3224adwe,Verified Purchase,Quality Office style printer for your home And budget,Printing and scanning is very simple once connected to computer. I have an older but updated iMac and for some reason I can’t print or scan through WiFi.

If the printer is connected to the computer with the USB there are no issues. This is the way I left it. It was also a bit of a confusing set up to connect to the google cloud print but it works now.

R1120UPLV1XOIE,"April 16, 2020",Dr. Stuart Gitlow,5,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,Easy setup. Excellent single pass full duplex scanner. Crisp clear color output.,"Unpacking: A few sheets of setup illustrations, an AC cord, a CD-ROM which was unnecessary for my Mac based installation, and the printer. Easy enough for one person to handle and one of the lighter full color laser printers I've handled.Setup: Usual Lexmark ease. Run the Lexmark app on your smartphone, connect to the printer, and then set up the printer with your home wifi network. Everything worked immediately thereafter and I could check from my computer to see whether the paper bin is full and how much toner remains in each cartridge. I noted that there's a side door for easy access to the excess toner collection module.Operation: Running with a Mac Pro and System 10.15.4, everything works smoothly and correctly. Very reasonably quiet operation, quick first print time, bright crisp color, and incredibly pleased by the single-pass duplex scanning capability. This latter feature is often overlooked but definitely makes quick work of scanning double-sided material. Note that many products have only single-side capability, and some have double-pass duplex capability, meaning they have to scan one side, flip the sheet, scan the other side, then flip it again to discharge it in the correct orientation. That takes forever when you're scanning a pile. This scanner brings in both sides simultaneously - quick, easy, and so far I've had no problems with the feed mechanism.The color touchscreen works properly and can be set up through Preferences to display only the commands that you want readily available. There's a small feeder so that you can put envelopes in without having to reload the single paper tray. And best yet, in my mind, is that you put paper into the tray in the same orientation that you want it printed - that is, the print will appear upright on the same side of the paper that faces up.

I'm tired of the inks either running out quick or the missing spots of printing. This was easy to setup for the most part after taking all the shipping tape off the printer. I did all the installation through the lexmark app.This was great because the lcd screen is way too small. It is a touch screen but its too small for a 2020 printer. The touch screen does let you select copy, fax etc when needed. The top feeder is excellent and the scanner made great copies, nice and clear.Its little on the noisy side but once the print comes out the unit shuts down fast so its quick to print and quiet again.The inks are very easy to remove when needed. the front is a flap that drops down and the inks are in a drawer that you pull out. Very easy!Print quality is nice but the colors were running on the green side for me. I'm also not able to tweet any settings because i'm using a mac. The supplied software disc is only for windows. Their online download section does NOT have anything for this model for mac os x.So while you can print and use all the functions you cannot do any adjustments from what i can tell as of yet. Hopefully soon there will be a mac version which i'm sure will come soon.Printing can also be done via iPad/iphone too. just download the mobile printing app. Note...make sure your devices are on the same network wifi as the printer or it won't show up as an available printer choice. I use a high quality smooth laser paper and the print outs look amazing other than the color shift which hopefully i can fix in the future.Price is a bit high for this printer but being its new maybe in a few months it will drop.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBHS9CLI3NVKS?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,0,0,No,

R249O2CUS9H2PY,"April 23, 2020",Dad5,1,C3426dw,Vine Customer,This one just wouldn't work...,"The Lexmark C3426 is an attractive, reasonably compact color laser printer that at least in this one case – just wouldn't work. The physical setup of the machine was simple with one sheet of illustrated instructions that was easy to follow (although the printer’s control panel keys are very small and difficult to use). The printer software was also simple to install and upon completion I was rewarded with a printer test page indicating the printer was “correctly installed”.And then the “fun” began. Despite a confirmed connection between computer and printer, a number of trial printing jobs resulted in “communication failure” error messages. The brief version: a one-page Word file printed just fine; a one-page Excel file had long delays for a queue issue and then either failed to print or printed one-half of the page and a one-page slideshow image failed to print at all. Not being a techie, I tried some of the standard fixes for a couple of hours, but nothing worked.Finally, I reached out to Lexmark technical support. The good news is that I was connected immediately. However, after two hours on the phone with the technician – during which I provided them with remote control of my computer; I moved the printer from the other room so it could be hooked up via ethernet directly to the router; and I watched patiently as they seemed to repeat clicks/commands that had already failed to work. Finally, I addressed the technician and asked what the prospects were for a resolution since we had been on the phone for two hours. I was told I probably had a wi-fi problem (despite the fact that the printer was located literally next to an Epson Workforce, with which we have no wi-fi issues) and that they were still trying to fix it. I also reminded the technician that (per the printer control panel) the printer was receiving the documents – it just wasn’t printing them.So, at that point I called a halt to the process and resolved to just return the printer to the box it came in.

R2HC9QGKLOCLA9,"April 20, 2020",Robert D. Harmon,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"sturdy, functional, good quality print","This printer was fairly easy to install and configure. The few sheets of instructions (pictograph) were a little puzzling but mainly involved steps in unpacking and untaping the unit (the outside tapes had a little folded-over bit at the end that made it easy to pull off -- no digging your thumbnail in). The installation CD is helpful but you can also download the manual from the Lexmark website, which appears to be good about product support, and the touch screen on the unit is easy to use, esp. regarding the Wifi connection. You will need to download the Lexmark printer driver, although the generic Windows driver worked well enough. The printer itself, so far, has proven fast, with fine print quality and good functionality, both for single-side printing and 2-side (duplex).Also, I've noticed no noticeable inrush, that is, the sudden electrical demand that a lot of laser printers make on startup and printing. I've had to exile some older laser printers to the other side of the house after they knock other devices off the circuit -- but not this one.Some minor quibbles: this is a straightforward color printer, with no scan or other functions. It can handle a fair range of paper sizes and weights, but is not a photo-quality printer. Unpacking the unit can be a problem, the unit is big and heavy enough, and in an outer Amazon box can be difficult to carry any distance; however, if you take the product box out you'll find handle-openings in that box, and easier to carry. You'll need a sturdy table or desk to hold the unit, and allow space not just for its footprint but a few inches around it for cooling.

R3OORQH2V2YHPH,"April 19, 2020",Blayne,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,Set up and printing wirelessly in under 10 minutes,"Review of: **Lexmark C3426dw Color Laser Printer**I literally unpacked this printer, set it up on its box on the floor, and was printing wirelessly from a laptop in under 10 minutes. No joke. All it required was to unpack the printer, follow the printed unpacking instructions to remove the tape and plastic protective tabs (I recommend using the printed instructions here because there were a set of shipping ""tabs"" in the print toner compartment that I would have missed), adding paper, and then following the manual on-screen setup prompts to get it online.I did use the WPS wifi config on my router to set this up. This is basically a simplified way to get the printer on your wireless network without even needing to enter the wifi password. I simply went through the setup on the printer, and then when it says to press the WPS button (within 120 seconds), press it (usually on the bottom of your router) and that was it. The printer was done configuring wireless. After the, a couple of steps to set the date/time/time zone, and I was done.Next, I added some paper to the tray and went into the Printer setup on my MacBook, picked the new Lexmark printer (it automatically appeared in the list of printers available), and I was done. I printed a page or two to test it, and also successfully printed from my iPhone X doing nothing more than selecting the Lexmark printer that automatically was listed as my (only) option to print (I don't have any other wireless printers online on my home network). Same story for my wife's laptop - absolutely seamless and simple setup.I have printed a few docs and other files so far, and am very impressed with the overall print quality. Sharp text, vibrant colors, and even pictures - which inexpensive laser printers are not really the best choice for printing on - look very good. And this is printing on stock office printer paper, nothing fancy. And I absolutely love having the option to print double-sided pages (duplex) without having to have the printer print on one side and then re-feed the paper into the printer upside down.Print speed is excellent, when warmed up this thing essentially prints instantly. When cold, it takes a few seconds - with a somewhat noisy fan kicking on - to get warmed up and then prints. Printing multiple pages is VERY fast for a light duty office printer. They claim 26ppm, or a page every ~2 seconds, and I have no doubt that is accurate.The only downsides I see are:-The printer is fairly heavy. The specs say about 35 pounds, but it almost feels heavier due to it's compact size.-Some of the construction feels a little cheap, in particular some of the plastic parts. When you open the toner door, you can feel a lot of flex in the plastic panel. And the plastic arms that allow the toner cartridge shelf to pull out feel very flimsy, like they would break if you pulled too hard. Nothing has actually broken yet, but some of these pieces could have been made of or reinforced with some metal.-There is no scanner. I know, this model is not sold as a MFP (multi-function printer), so I am not dinging it due to this. But keep it in mind if you need the option to use your printer as a copier.-The paper tray has to be extended out for legal size paper, making the depth of the printer a few inches more. (It took me a few minutes to figure out how this printer could accept legal size paper at all, like the product information states. The manual isn't very clear, but you need to extend the paper tray outward toward the front of the printer, and when you do this, the white plastic face plate actually sticks out further than when you are using letter size paper or smaller. If you want to print on 8.5x17 paper you have to use the manual feed slot just above the paper tray.)I cannot comment on how long the toner cartridges will last or the long term durability/reliability since I have only been using the printer for a few days. Should I discover anything in these areas that is an issue, I will update this review.From a print quality and performance, this gets a solid 5 stars for a ~$400 laser printer. I am dropping half of a one star from my overall rating due to the slight flimsiness in some of the plastic parts and the inability to handle paper larger than letter size from the print tray without making it stick out. That makes my overall rating 4.5 stars (rounding up to 5 for the Amazon review limitations).If you are looking for a solid laser print performer in a home office or small office with a small footprint, I highly recommend you consider this Lexmark C3426dw model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OORQH2V2YHPH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,0,0,No,
R35ZD0PWWYE2R1,"April 19, 2020",Walter,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, a little difficult to setup","We needed a color printer for our office and thought this would be a good choice. The small footprint is a huge plus since we have limited space. The initial setup was easy enough using my wife’s Chromebook and the printer’s touchscreen. But we had to use the included CD before the Windows 10 laptops would recognize it. That slowed things down considerably.Out of the box there is a lot of tape and tags to be removed, but there is an instruction sheet with pictures to show you where to find them. There is also a cd containing an app that needed to be installed on each of our Windows laptops before they could find the printer. There were no other instructions. It some tinkering and about an hour to get all 3 Win10 laptops to print anything so some instructions would have been nice. There was a very bothersome SMTP error that wouldn’t go away even once the printer was printing. I had to reboot the laptop and unplug the printer to resolve the issue.Once the setup was complete everything went smoothly. The printer works just fine printing single or double-sided pages in black and white or in color. Printing is relatively silent. The speed is good, but not great at 26 ppm. Hopefully the toner lasts as long as Lexmark claims as the biggest drawback to any printer is the cost of running it.As for quality it does a great job with text and graphics, but I wouldn’t recommend it for photos. We tested it by printing our multicolor brochures that contain some colorful infographics and backgrounds. These looked quite nice and are much higher quality that the inkjet we were using. I also tried printing a couple of photos, but they were lack-luster and rather dull. My inkjet does a much better job in that regard.One note about shipping: while the Amazon box was in good condition, the printer box inside was damaged. Fortunately, the printer was not.So far so good. I have another Lexmark printer that we stopped using before the end of the first week because it couldn’t print even a single page job without jamming.

You can use the ones for Windows 10 but it won’t support all the features. What’s the point?I’m not wild about the necessity of using CD-ROMs, which do come with this.

Appears to meet or exceed promised print rate at single side.- Unclear whether this printer is field upgradeable.- Not measured, but this printer seemed to be a little more stingy with power during printing that our two Brother printers (which are >7 years old).- At least as good or better than our Canon laser printer (which jams now and then and can be difficult to clear)CON- Appears to be only 2.4 WiFi networks- Minor difficulty reseating the print cartridge during initial installation. There is an interlock that prevents you from proceeding.- Unclear how the field upgrades work if made available.- A lot of setup software is needed. For Windows 7 (obsolete), for instance, it could not find a suitable driver online. A completely web-based installer vs. the supplied CD might have been easier. That said, it worked OK, though it puts more running tasks into your system (tray, notifications, etc.).- In testing, noticed that after it had put itself to sleep, the printer would power itself up and go through a warming or self-test procedure (but not print anything.) May have been a one-off glitch.- The paper Quick Start Guide was not as helpful as the onboard setup tips.- Unclear if it's EnergyStar 3.0 (final version, February 2020)TIPS and REMARKSTo ease setting up WiFi, use the optional Lexmark app to assist in setting up the WiFi connection. The app will take over your network connection briefly for this purpose -- similar to what Alexa or Google Home devices do during setup.The Lexmark device allows you to skip setting up its admin password. Because this occurs so early in the setup, it's not clear what it's for.

R2DRQBEFVWVPBQ,"March 17, 2020",Walter,2,MB3442adw,Vine Customer,Biggest headache ever,"I ordered this for our new office since we didn’t have a printer yet. We (my wife and I) had been doing all the office printing at home on an inkjet.I tested it at home the day it arrived. The setup isn’t as quick and easy as Lexmark claims. There are no written instructions, just a page with pictures and arrows that seem to be trying to illustrate where all the packing tape is so you can remove it. There was plenty of that. When I removed the paper tray, a large piece came loose from underneath and fell off. It took several minutes to figure out how to reinstall that.Once I was sure all the tape was removed and got some paper loaded, I decided to try and go through the setup menu on the touch screen. It took about half a dozen attempts to navigate it correctly. It said something about using an app to set it up and I tried but was not successful. It wasn’t until I did a manual setup that I got it to work. Then the app (which I had installed on my phone) was able to find it.I used my phone to print several test pages (including a couple of images) and it printed them quickly. They were the high quality that you would expect from a laser printer.Lexmark is a reputable brand and I would expect this to be a printer that will last a long time. I would also expect good customer service (I was tempted to call during setup).I think we will be satisfied with it. I'm giving it only four stars due to the difficulty with the setup.UPDATE 04/02/2020:We have stopped using this printer. It began jamming during every print job. Repeat every print job. The worst part is that there really isn't any jammed paper. It is always a sheet that didn't eject properly, but I have to take the printer apart looking for the jam in order to clear the error code. This includes removing the paper tray which always causes a piece to fall out. To put it back together I have to turn the printer on its side. I have to do this every single time. It has been at least 10 days since I got a print job without a paper jam. I'm convinced the problem centers around the part that keeps falling out.

RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",PBV-JSV,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively.

RA4TT0RCQT8VK,"March 27, 2020",Robert J. Newell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast, Good Print Quality, Easy to Hook Up, But Where's the Toner?","Let's be clear, it's a good printer. It was easy to set up, has decent features, and the print quality is good.Setup: cabled setup is easy, although if you're not going to go wireless, you'll have to supply your own cable, whether USB or Ethernet. I won't dock them for that, although they could have said ""cable not supplied"" in their writeups. This just worked out of the box on my Linux system. For Windows, you should probably download drivers from the Lexmark support site. Not sure about Mac.Wireless setup is accomplished from the little display window on the printer. I've always found this annoying but if you run Windows and want to install their software you can avoid this. But there is nothing hard about it, just a little tedium, and it works as it should, although I always prefer the Ethernet option. (Tip: on your router, assign a fixed IP address to the printer. This makes life easier for non-USB connections.)Okay, how does it work? Just fine. Double sided printing is wonderful, print quality is great, speed is about what you'd expect today--- in other words, very good for a home printer used by a few people. (Don't expect to use this in a 20 person office, though.) It's a light-duty printer, very suitable for a home office.Build quality is good. Don't drop it off tall buildings, but don't be afraid to move it around or carry it around. It should stand up just fine.Now, the one gripe. Toner. It comes with the plague of printers in pretty much the last decade, the dreaded ""starter"" cartridge. This is a cartridge that is maybe 10% full, meaning you have to buy a real cartridge almost right away. And guess what, the cartridge price is in the same range as the printer price in most cases. Manufacturers don't have to make money on the printer, they make it on the cartridge.The ""starter"" is supposed to be good for 500 pages, about one ream. If that holds up, depending on your needs, you might get a week or two in a busy home office, and maybe a month or two of really casual use.So you better order that cartridge. You go to the Lexmark site and ... oh my, they aren't selling them. Maybe a little later on? Better hope so, or pretty soon you'll have a brick. This is 100% inexcusable. And comparing similar Lexmark printers, the cartridge will be over a hundred dollars. Wow.Usually there are 3rd-party cartridges, often for about 15% of the price. That's what I always buy for my other printers; I find a reputable vendor and buy from them. But you cannot get the cartridge for this printer anywhere at the time of this writing (late March 2020).I'm going to provisionally rate the printer four stars. After all, it's a very good product. I would have gone five if the cartridges were available at a fair price. I will revisit this later. If in a month or two you still can't get the cartridge, the rating will be one star.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4TT0RCQT8VK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,1,0,No,

The Unison toner cartridge doesn't need shaking to equalize printing and prints at lower temperature than previous types of toner, so that means lower energy costs as well as quicker printing from a cold start. My only issue is probably due to this being a new item that I received through the Amazon Vine program.

R2IL5WOCYEQBP6,"April 19, 2020",Hyytekk,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Why do printer manufacturers assume everyone employs an IT department?,"Printers are supposed to be patient servants who sit idle, but snap to attention when you need them. They do seem too if you have a wired connection. Adding Wifi seems to reduce the printer's IQ by half. Unless you have your own IT department or a 12 year old close by to rescue you. Now that that's out of the way, here are my impressions of this Lexmark B3340 so far. I was looking for a replacement for my Cannon, that was most of all intuitive and whose Wifi just plain worked every time. Unboxing seemed promising but suspect since documentation included one sheet of printed media and a DVD. The single sheet of ""instructions"" contained no words, just a few cave wall drawings with a helpful bent page indicator in the lower right hand corner indicating the need to turn the page over to continue. Good thing, I never would have noticed it was printed on both sides! Step 12 indicates you need to turn the printer on. The final step indicates you insert the DVD into your laptop. If only laptops still had DVD readers. In my Apple world those are barely even remembered. So there we both sat in awkward silence.There is a tiny, single line display so I decided to break the ice and start pushing the few buttons there. It asked if I wanted to set it up using an app. Yes please. I downloaded the only Lexmark app I could find onto my phone, but that proved to be a dead end. I used my iMac to try to locate drivers for the B3340 and finally wading through microscopic online print and charts seemed to find what I needed so clicked the hyperlink for Mac. Nothing downloaded. I connected the printer to my desktop to see if that might make a love connection. I thankfully had the correct cable. Would have been nice if Lexmark had included one but maybe no one does that any more. Though others seem to make even a tiny effort to give you a modicum of direction. I opened my Printer preference tab, and by golly, it had recognized the new printer. Clicking on some options seemed promising but still no directions. I went back to that single line display and started clicking through and eventually found an option to connect to Wifi. It found my network thankfully and asked for my password. I hoped there might be a more handy input method. But no, you need to go through small a, capital A, small b capital B, etc. for each part of your password. Mine dutifully is 10 characters long so it was a lot of tapping. Eventually all was set up, and I directed the computer to print a page and selected the Lexmark. Thankfully it instantly printed the page, though the quality seemed a little light and non-crisp. Imagining there were internal adjustments I went back to single line display, but nothing there. In the mean time the printer went into sleep mode. I opened the Printer choices but nothing helpful there. After pushing the back arrow on the printer it said it was ""ready"" and fully awake. Thats when, in the Printer section under the ""general"" tab, there was a tiny box that said it would take you to the printer web site. I bit, and although it's not obvious at all, there are nests of settings that will adjust your printer, including print quality and darkness level. I made the adjustments, printed another page and the page was beautiful. I was interrupted but returned to make sure all was in order, tried to print another page but nothing. It said it couldn't find the printer. Ten minutes later, the page printed.Over all, this seems to be a solid relatively compact printer. It says it's made out of steel though the exterior seems like hard plastic. The single line of display gives basic information only after lots of clicking and little intuitive guidance. Once all is set up to the settings of your choice, it seems promising. I cancelled sleep mode but it still seems to doze off and not print wirelessly on command. I'll keep tinkering. In conclusion, unit build seems solid, compact and unencumbered by buttons and blinking lights. Five stars there. As for helpful setup directions or any guidance I would give it zero stars if possible. I believe this will prove to be a solid, reliable printer. As long as I don't need to wake it up by physically pushing a button on the controls, and the wifi proves reliable, I should be happy. If you're reading Lexmark, can't you simply include a second piece of printed instructions that gives a buyer even a scrap of guidance? At least for customers who exist in the Apple universe, or with Windows laptops that lack DVD access?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IL5WOCYEQBP6?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,0,0,No,

But it is awesome so far!I'm replacing a 20-year-old high-end Brother printer, so I'll compare it to that. The Brother cost $600 20 years ago, so I was not expecting much at all from a $117 printer.Most of the negative reviews mentioned trouble connecting via WiFi. My first thought was I didn't care about that. I've never had a WiFi printer in the past and didn't see any reason it would be necessary now. However, I have gotten married since 20 years ago and we have kids and more computers in the house, so I figured if it worked that would be great and if not, well, it was only $117 and we didn't have a networked printer in the past so it would be okay.Of course, once it arrived, connecting it to WiFi became my first obsession! I guess I just wanted to try it that cool new feature!I've never connected a printer to WiFi and wasn't sure how it worked. The printed materials that came with the printer were totally useless. It's all pictures, no words and nothing about connecting via Wifi. But, all the info you need, really, is on the printer screen. Even though it's tiny, I was able to get the information I needed from it to connect it up.Basically, I turned the printer on, read the directions as they scrolled across on the tiny screen and followed the directions. It mentioned a Lexmark printer app, which I downloaded. I was able to quickly and easily connect the app on my phone to the printer and from there it was a breeze. It went through the steps and I was able to print from my phone. Which again, was not something I had ever imagined doing, much less anything I needed or wanted to do. But it worked and that was cool!Then it was off to connect two computers to it. First I plugged it in by wire to my wife's computer - which I think might have been a mistake. But at the time I thought that's how you had to do it. For some reason I wasn't able to get it to connect via WiFi on her computer because while the computer ""saw"" the printer, it kept asking me for a WPS PIN which it said was either printed on the printer or was on the printed materials that came with the printer. It was on neither.I gave up on that and went to install it via WiFi only on my computer. Actually I didn't really have to do anything. I opened the Printer Settings on my computer and clicked Add Printer, then find WiFi connected printer and it was right there. So it was already broadcasting the signal to all devices in our house and all I had to do was click Connect - and it worked like a charm. The weird thing though is it didn't ask me for any WPS PIN for my computer. And I'm guessing that's because I never connected it via wire - so it didn't halfway install itself by wire only to get confused by WiFi? I don't know. But I did not ever attach it to my computer with a wire and the WiFi connected up absolutely flawlessly.Then I went back to my wife's computer and using the disk that came with the printer I installed the drivers from that. And once that was done, suddenly it worked fine as a WiFi printer. Although it shows up in Printer Settings as (copy1) of the first attempted installation by wire, which still works if it's plugged in with the wire.Then for the big test. I moved the printer to another room! Would we both be able to print on it from our respective offices? My wife's office is closest and mine is further away... about 50 feet away and several drywall walls. From my wife's office, everything went off without a hitch. From my office - same result. Print Perfect both times.My old $600 Brother printer did excellent color prints, and this one does as well - for 1/6th the price. I printed a few photos from the Lexmark, as a test, and was absolutely amazed at their quality. They're almost photo-printer quality. In fact, if I printed them on laser photo paper, I think they'd look good enough to frame and hang.The other nifty feature is the double-sided print feature. Maybe this is something that's been common among printers for the last few years, I'm not sure. But if you're not used to it, it's very cool. It will print on both sides of the paper - automatically. In other words, you don't have to print on one side and then stick the page in upside down and print the other side manually anymore. It will print the first side, then suck the page back into the printer and print the other side! It's really amazing to watch if you've never seen a printer do this before. And it's so fast.One other plus factor is that it's much smaller and lighter than our old printer. The old one, I literally can't lift by myself it's so darn heavy. Something around 100 pounds I think. But this one is much easier to lift, it's like a heavy suitcase. We also appreciate that it takes up much less space than the old behemoth did.One con so far... they include about 7 or 8 sheets of paper (printed on both sides - that's 16 pages of printing) with nothing other than safety warnings - in every imaginable language. The length of the English text wouldn't take up more than about 2 paragraphs, not even a full page. So it's a colossal waste of paper they include and completely unnecessary. Not to mention the hassle they cause all their customers with so much extra paper they have to throw out. BIG WASTE. I have to think that the United States is their largest market and as such might warrant it's own version of this in English and perhaps Spanish. But no... they literally had to print it in almost every major language on earth - and send it in every major language to every customer! Totally ridiculous, wasteful and annoying.The only instructions are what looks like a hand-drawn diagram with little arrows drawn here and there. Not a single word printed on these two pages - where words would be extremely helpful. Apparently the folks at Lexmark don't want to *offend* anyone by writing in the language/languages spoken in the United States only, so they opt not to print any words at all. As if instructions in English might offend people! Like the United States is such a small market it's not worth their time and effort to print in English and Spanish.Other than that big annoyance though, we're both very pleased with this purchase. I'm still amazed at all the complaints - and really surprised it has only a 3.7-star review score. That's way below where it should be in my humble opinion.I have seen some reviewers say it worked well at first but after a few weeks it went bad. So, if that happens here, I'll come back and definitely adjust my score accordingly, and revise my review to let you know.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HIYF66AQ9YY4?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,136,2,No,

George,4,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Doesn't have enough memory to print multi-page documents,"I took a chance and got this printer based on the positive Amazon Vine reviews. The set up was a breeze, even using just the control panel and not the app. However, I tried printing a 20-page PDF that has a file size of 5mb. The printer could not process the PDF and would only print a single page and give me an error saying that the memory is full. So then I tried to just print two pages from the PDF, and it can't even handle that. If it can't print a multi-page document it is pretty worthless. And there is no way you can print 24 pages a minute if you have to print them one page at a time. If you just want to print a single page all the time, than this printer would be great for you, and the print quality was good. But if you need to print a multi-page document... you'll want to look somewhere else. Needless to say, I will be returning this and buying another HP or Brother printer.Update #1 - I spent a whole day trying to get this printer to work. I reinstalled it multiple times, restored factory settings, reset it up, updated the printer firmware, updated my operating system, and then finally figured out that if I installed it using generic post script printing and boom! it works.

I've wasted so much money on bad inkjet printers that clog over time not to mention all the ink cartridges. I run a small business and need a printer only sporadically for invoicing and bulk photo printing. The review...1. The setup was not without it's challenges. You just need to make sure that you connect the Wifi to the printer first through the printer control panel then proceed with downloading the appropriate drivers/apps for your device. I found it really easy to connect the devices actually. My Google phone and Chromebook latched on immediately. I could see how others could have issues figuring this out though. I'm fairly tech savvy but it still took me a few minutes of fiddling. I don't understand the lack of included instructions out of the box or online. You really just need a small note card that could walk you through it but nothing, weird. The printing software is nothing to write home about and typically no frills.2. Quality for text is very good of course since it's a laser. Photos are okay. They aren't as poppy or crisp as most inkjets in the same price range but it's passable, at least for my needs. I didn't expect too much for the photo printing (due to reviews I read) but it actually met or exceeded my expectations. If photos are your main interest then you shouldn't be looking at a laser anyway.3. Although this is compact compared to other laser printers, it's not exactly small. It takes up as much space as a small multifunction inkjet. The advantage is that I can shove this unit into a shelf because it doesn't have a scanner top that you need to lift. I realized over time that I use a scanner maybe once a year so I wanted forgo that function.Initially, I am super happy with this. The price is amazing!! It does exactly what I need it to do for use as a basic office printer. I've been buying inkjets all my life. I hope that I don't have to deal with clogged printer heads ever again. I was also weary of buying a 'Lexmark' since there is very little hype about this brand. But I love the no frills design and function of this unit.

No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem.

R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,4,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,39,0,No,
R218MLO8BAOX78,"November 8, 2019",MH,1,MC3224adwe,Verified Purchase,THIS PRINTER IS NOT USER FRIENDLY.,"The only things positive about a Lexmark MC3224adwe printer was its print quality and its physical construction (51 lbs). The printer was delivered without written support to setup this printer. Lexmark's online information is essentially meaningless. It was not only hard to understand, but it was vastly incomplete and misleading. After spending over 10 hours on the telephone with Lexmark's 3rd party contractor/support team, the technician got the printer to print properly. The technician could not get the scanner to function with the Lexmark information supplied to the 3rd party support team. The scanner worked after being ""jerry rigged"" by the technician with a non Lexmark product. Whoever designed Lexmark's software did not seem know what they were doing. The printer is built like a tank with the brain of a worm.

Nonetheless, I nearly sent this printer back after starting to read faq and hunting through the HORRIBLE Lexmark site. I just didn't want to deal with a bunch of stress simply to setup a desktop printer. That said, it took me all of 5-minutes (Windows 10) to get things up and running: remove tape and tabs that are clearly indicated, load paper, power up and follow instructions on the touchscreen. I did not install the included CD software; I did not do any firmware update - it's working fine, so unless I find something, it'll likely stay this way. Every computer in our office group connected easily (Add Printer, found the Lex immediately, select ...done).This model (MC3224dwe) does NOT have fax; I assumed this was an ""all-in-one"" device which is how I started my search criteria: ""all in one color laser printer"".

R2ILGSJOL4M04X,"October 3, 2019",Jen,1,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,I couldn't get this printer to work,"I have been researching printers and trying to decide on one for at least 6 months now. I finally decided to go with this one because it seems all printers get bad reviews but this one didn't seem to be too bad. I received my first one very quickly and I was very excited. I opened it and saw that the scanning bed was cracked. So, back in the box it went. Mind you, this is a heavy machine and it's not easy to pack it up, etc. I requested a new one to be sent to me.The second machine took longer to get to me but I got it in about 3 days. I got it out of the box and got it set up. I connected it to my internet and thought things would be realitively each. No such luck. You have to down load an app to your phone to be able to print from your phone. I do a LOT of printing from my phone or Ipad. So, I down load the app and it can't find the printer even though they are on the same network. After getting the manual off of HP website and doing some searching, I realize it's because one of the settings is wrong. Sorry - I can't remember the setting now and I don't have the printer any longer. So, I set the indicator and it seems my phone sees the printer. Yea! So, I go to send a document to the printer. It's about a 10 page document. My current deskjet would hardly take any time to print this type of document. I waited and waited, etc.... The printer kept saying it was receiving the document but wasn't printing. After about 30 minutes, I decided to try to set up the software on my printer. Of course, in the middle of setting up the software, the printer decided to 'start' printing my document but only printed about a quarter of one page and that is all I ever saw it print.So, I decided to try to concentrate on getting my computer set up. Again, my deskjet was never an issue. Find the printer and start printing. I updated the software and tried to print a document again from my computer. I kept getting communication errors between my computer and the printer. The printer was online the whole time and so was my computer. Mind you this went on for a few hours one night and into the next day.When I finally think something is printing, it printed a small box and then I got a firmware error. So, I went to look for an update. Again, you have to connect thru your computer to the printer using the computer number. The printer was showing me the number but everytime I tried to access it, it would time out. I tried this for a few hours. This is the only way I could find in the manual to actually update the firmware on the printer, but since I could not get to the actual menu, I couldn't update it.By this time, I'm fed up. So, I decided in the end to just return the second machine also. Please keep in mind, that I work in IT. I'm not a hardware person, but I can figure out most things if I have instructions. I don't know how they expect anyone to get this working without support. Yes, I could have called for help and it might have been resolved, but I don't like to have to call for help.

R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ,"July 29, 2019",Just Plain Larry,3,MB2236adwe,Vine Customer,3 stars and I'll explain in the review WHY only 3,"===Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.===Review begins:Just a heads up since some people may miss this. Monochrome= black and white printing ONLY. This is NOT a color laser printerThis has the POTENTIAL to be a great printer but there are several things that caused me to deduct pointsPROS:1. Good print speed. I did a 50 page double sided document in less than 2 minutes.2. 3 ways to connect. Wireless, Ethernet or USB3. Good scanning speed. I scanned a 20 page document in 40 seconds. And it WILL scan to a color document, it just won't PRINT in color.4. Compact and lightweight. At 16.5"" W x 13"" D x 14"" high it will fit almost anywhere. And at 16 pounds weight, it is a breeze to carry around. If you are old school like me, and you remember the early lasers that required 2 men, a horse and a hoist to put in place, you will appreciate the lightweight of this product5. Automatic Duplex Printing. You don't have to wait for it to print the odd numbered pages, and then reload the first prints for the even numbered pages. It automatically pulls the sheet back and prints the second side6. 250 page paper tray. Not nearly as much paper loading. And it handles letter and LEGAL size easily.6. At 5% toner lay down, you get crisp clear sharp text.7. Starter cartridge included.8. Built-n Web Server so you can check on status, jobs, level of supplies etc.9. It's multi-function so you can fax, scan, copy or print.10. When it's done for the day, it takes you out to dinner. OK not really, but it does a lot of things.So with all that, why only 3 stars you ask?1. The setup guide is a pictograph, not text.2. There is no manual included in the box or on the CD. I can understand not including a 187 page manual on paper, but they could have at least included the manual in PDF format on the CD. I had to go to support.lexmark.com to get the manual.3. It has a separate imaging unit from the toner cartridge. The unit is rated for 12,000 pages. We don't usually print that much in a year, but what about folks who print 3,000 pages a month? Every 4 months you will have to replace the imaging unit.4. And now, My BIGGEST gripe about this product. TONER COST!!!!!!!! Unless you are willing to participate in their Return program, which means you buy the cartridge and only use it once you can expect to pay $275-$350 for an extra high yield cartridge (6,000 pages) and from $90-$150 for a regular cartridge (1,200 pages) . And even on the return program for a regular yield (1,200 pages) they start at $48 depending on where you shop for it.Between having to replace toner, and having an external imaging unit, I don't care that it takes you out for dinner (again, just kidding). The operating costs for this product are too high for every day usage except in a small office. I was hoping to retire my old HP 1020, but that isn't going to happen until the consumable costs come way down. This printer is a fairly new release, so it is hard to find remanufactured consumables yet.So if you can overlook the consumables cost, then this is a good printer for daily use, even if it is not economical to use. The output is clear and sharp. Scanner works great. I did not test the fax since our fax server is in another room from the printer. Fast printing. Fast scanning. Wi-Fi enabled.

R7J71FM6H53QM,"October 1, 2019",Ideal One,1,MB2236adwe,Verified Purchase,Do Not Purchase,I purchased this Lexmark to my utter disappointment. There is no manual on how to set it up. There was no drivers included in the box. When I tried to scan a document the scanning feature required a password that was not provided nor could I reprogram. I went online to watch videos on how to install drivers and how to install the intitial settings. The only video on youtube or on Lexmark's website was how to remove the tape from the printer.

Not sure why you would even make an ADF without auto-duplex, it kills your efficiency.2. Windows 10 drivers need to be loaded from enclosed CD.

RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,3,MB2236adw,Verified Purchase,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights"," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGZ49J58DX0W5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,66,6,No,

I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking. I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome. However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work. Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error. I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message! The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRBP7OITNW73Q?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,8,1,No,

RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,4,MB2236adw,Verified Purchase,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.","PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYUB0RC2X96PZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,3,0,No,

I have had this printer less than one year, and the duplex feature has broken. The printer still tries to force duplexing often, but as it goes to pull the paper back in after printing the first side, it jams every time. I cannot turn off the double-sided printing on the printer (and have it stay that way). I have to remember every time I print (which is a big time-waster) to turn it off.-------------------I am amending my review after using this printer for awhile. I changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars. It takes some getting used to.I was used to just putting things in the manual feed slot (checks, envelopes, special paper, etc.) and my old printer would always auto-select it when it sensed something there. This one, you need to make sure your print option is manual feed to avoid problems/jams.It still always defaults to duplex when I don't want it, making my print twice sometimes and waste more paper than its green ""enviro-leaf"" symbol is trying to save, but oh well, the wacky world we live in now.---------------------------------[old review below]I run a busy small office. I keep a printer on my desktop for small jobs, printing checks, and envelopes, and I send large jobs to my network printer. I have used this printer for a few weeks now.First the good:This printer is fast and the print quality is good.The bad:1. The separate single feed slot that I use for checks and envelopes doesn't draw well and has to be almost always separately selected when a job is sent to print. It jams all the time. A big waste of time and this problem alone means that I would never recommend this printer.2. When regular letter-sized paper is put in the main tray, you have to open the rear door of the printer (like you were using over-sized paper) and leave it open, else the main tray won't fit in.3. I don't duplex much of my work, but it keeps reverting to duplexing after every time I change the settings (I guess it's trying to force ""saving the planet"" on me, instead of allowing me to use it how best works for my business)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M22TBFV1XCXW?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,3,0,No,

There are no written instructions, just a page with pictures and arrows that seem to be trying to illustrate where all the packing tape is so you can remove it. There was plenty of that. When I removed the paper tray, a large piece came loose from underneath and fell off. It took several minutes to figure out how to reinstall that.Once I was sure all the tape was removed and got some paper loaded, I decided to try and go through the setup menu on the touch screen. It took about half a dozen attempts to navigate it correctly. It said something about using an app to set it up and I tried but was not successful. It wasn’t until I did a manual setup that I got it to work. Then the app (which I had installed on my phone) was able to find it.I used my phone to print several test pages (including a couple of images) and it printed them quickly. They were the high quality that you would expect from a laser printer.Lexmark is a reputable brand and I would expect this to be a printer that will last a long time. I would also expect good customer service (I was tempted to call during setup).I think we will be satisfied with it. I'm giving it only four stars due to the difficulty with the setup.UPDATE 04/02/2020:We have stopped using this printer. It began jamming during every print job. Repeat every print job. The worst part is that there really isn't any jammed paper. It is always a sheet that didn't eject properly, but I have to take the printer apart looking for the jam in order to clear the error code. This includes removing the paper tray which always causes a piece to fall out. To put it back together I have to turn the printer on its side. I have to do this every single time. It has been at least 10 days since I got a print job without a paper jam. I'm convinced the problem centers around the part that keeps falling out. But since there was no user guide or manual and I can't find this printer on Lexmark's website, I have no idea how to fix the problem.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DRQBEFVWVPBQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,1,0,No,

It only includes a one page (two-sided) series of illustrations showing you were to remove all of the packing material.2. I went to the Lexmark website to find set-up instructions (driver is supplied as a CD-ROM, but none of my computers have a CD-ROM drive so I needed to download the drivers). Searching on their website for information yields no results for this model.3. Fumbling through the on-screen set-up, selecting to run initial set-up just returns you to the main menu. It doesn't do anything.4. The ""troubleshooting"" selection only has two choices. print test pages and cleaning the scanner5. Even a Google search for help turns up no results. Its like this printer doesn't even exist and is a figment of my imagination.6. Purchased a printer cable to connect directly to the computer. Finally found the correct driver on the Lexmark site and downloaded it (it isn't labeled for this specific model I ended up just selecting what appeared to be the newest driver available). Was finally able to print directly connected. Wi-Fi still won't set up, even though my Wi-Fi network was able to find the printer and connect it. Neither my laptop or my desktop can ""find"" the printer to connect via wi-fi.7. Keep getting an ""E-mail SMTP server not set up"" error message each time I print. When to the Embedded Web Server site and cannot see any way to get rid of the error. Cannot ""log in"" to the web server site because I do not have a log in set up. Google search returns results for how to get rid of the error, but you can't follow those directions without logging in, which I can't do.The print QUALITY, when it does print, is fine. It is possible I just got a bad unit and my problems are not indicative of the model overall. But the lack of easily discernable instructions ANYWHERE for this model, and the fact that no site returns results for this model when looking for things like toner is a problem.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F4VUUPLQOC2Q?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,1,0,No,
R19VCBQED4CYJ0,"March 14, 2020",Once in a while,5,MB3442adw,Vine Customer,Awesome all-in-one machine with versatile scanning options,"I had this office quality monochrome laser printing/scanning/copy machine set up and operating in less than 20 minutes without a hitch. A software CD is included, but it wasn't needed for setup. Once we had it connected to our WiFi network, our Mac iOS and Linux computers recognized and operated it as a printer right away. The Mac recognized the scan function too.Speaking of scanning, this machine does both sheet fed scanning and flatbed scanning/copying/faxing. All functions are operable directly from the touch screen control panel (which is simple and intuitive) as well as from your computer.There are several connectivity options, including corded via USB or Ethernet cable, or WiFi wireless. The most secure means to print documents is via corded connection, but Lexmark includes ""full spectrum security"" as an option.I didn't put a timer on it to see if it really prints 42 pages per minute, but it is fast, and the print quality is of course laser printer sharp. And it does two-sided printing.There's a lot to like here. The only minor negative is that it is a monochrome printer (black toner only) and not full color. But I owned a color laser printer for years and was never too impressed with its color output or reproduction. I think ink jet printers are better at that. Laser printers excel at super sharp and cost effective black and white printing, and laser printed pages are water resistant---they don't smear and spread if a bit of water drops on them like ink jet ink tends to do.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19VCBQED4CYJ0?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,1,0,No,

Helpful setup process.,"General: This product replaced a Brother multifunction printer. We also have a smaller ""single function"" Brother and also a Canon laser printer for comparison.This generation of printers is faster, easier to set up and more flexible than earlier generations (any make).Size matters. Printers are used less often these days for most people, so having a smaller footprint is important.Apart from price, you may wish to consider whether you need a color laser printer, which gives you a nicer appearance for presentation handouts, but will require more and specialized consumables.PRO- Small footprint- Supports hardwired ethernet as well as wireless, USB- Well-placed network security- Color LCD to well thought-out cues to aid with setup (see photo).- Fast . Appears to meet or exceed promised print rate at single side.- Unclear whether this printer is field upgradeable.- Not measured, but this printer seemed to be a little more stingy with power during printing that our two Brother printers (which are >7 years old).- At least as good or better than our Canon laser printer (which jams now and then and can be difficult to clear)CON- Appears to be only 2.4 WiFi networks- Minor difficulty reseating the print cartridge during initial installation. There is an interlock that prevents you from proceeding.- Unclear how the field upgrades work if made available.- A lot of setup software is needed. For Windows 7 (obsolete), for instance, it could not find a suitable driver online. A completely web-based installer vs. the supplied CD might have been easier. That said, it worked OK, though it puts more running tasks into your system (tray, notifications, etc.).- In testing, noticed that after it had put itself to sleep, the printer would power itself up and go through a warming or self-test procedure (but not print anything.) May have been a one-off glitch.- The paper Quick Start Guide was not as helpful as the onboard setup tips.- Unclear if it's EnergyStar 3.0 (final version, February 2020)TIPS and REMARKSTo ease setting up WiFi, use the optional Lexmark app to assist in setting up the WiFi connection. The app will take over your network connection briefly for this purpose -- similar to what Alexa or Google Home devices do during setup.The Lexmark device allows you to skip setting up its admin password. Because this occurs so early in the setup, it's not clear what it's for. Once you have it working, be sure to go back and set it up; otherwise, it's a risk to your network.Recommend contacting Lexmark RE field upgrade options before purchasing.

Most of the things that we print are typically not in color, so we keep a separate printer for that.

We were not able to find drivers online for this printer, and we looked for over 15 minutes. It simply should not be that hard to find something necessary for the use of the product. You can use the ones for Windows 10 but it won’t support all the features. What’s the point?I’m not wild about the necessity of using CD-ROMs, which do come with this. Newer machines usually don’t support CDs. Also, with CDs, they will usually not include the most up to date drivers. The lack of information available online is troubling, and for anyone NOT in a tech field, is going to be beyond frustrating. Hell, I’m in IT and I’m frustrated.

There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone.

RA4TT0RCQT8VK,"March 27, 2020",Robert J. Newell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast, Good Print Quality, Easy to Hook Up, But Where's the Toner?","Let's be clear, it's a good printer. It was easy to set up, has decent features, and the print quality is good.Setup: cabled setup is easy, although if you're not going to go wireless, you'll have to supply your own cable, whether USB or Ethernet. I won't dock them for that, although they could have said ""cable not supplied"" in their writeups. This just worked out of the box on my Linux system. For Windows, you should probably download drivers from the Lexmark support site. Not sure about Mac.Wireless setup is accomplished from the little display window on the printer. I've always found this annoying but if you run Windows and want to install their software you can avoid this. But there is nothing hard about it, just a little tedium, and it works as it should, although I always prefer the Ethernet option. (Tip: on your router, assign a fixed IP address to the printer. This makes life easier for non-USB connections.)Okay, how does it work? Just fine. Double sided printing is wonderful, print quality is great, speed is about what you'd expect today--- in other words, very good for a home printer used by a few people. (Don't expect to use this in a 20 person office, though.) It's a light-duty printer, very suitable for a home office.Build quality is good. Don't drop it off tall buildings, but don't be afraid to move it around or carry it around. It should stand up just fine.Now, the one gripe. Toner. It comes with the plague of printers in pretty much the last decade, the dreaded ""starter"" cartridge. This is a cartridge that is maybe 10% full, meaning you have to buy a real cartridge almost right away. And guess what, the cartridge price is in the same range as the printer price in most cases. Manufacturers don't have to make money on the printer, they make it on the cartridge.The ""starter"" is supposed to be good for 500 pages, about one ream. If that holds up, depending on your needs, you might get a week or two in a busy home office, and maybe a month or two of really casual use.So you better order that cartridge. You go to the Lexmark site and ... oh my, they aren't selling them. Maybe a little later on? Better hope so, or pretty soon you'll have a brick. This is 100% inexcusable. And comparing similar Lexmark printers, the cartridge will be over a hundred dollars. Wow.Usually there are 3rd-party cartridges, often for about 15% of the price. That's what I always buy for my other printers; I find a reputable vendor and buy from them. But you cannot get the cartridge for this printer anywhere at the time of this writing (late March 2020).I'm going to provisionally rate the printer four stars. After all, it's a very good product. I would have gone five if the cartridges were available at a fair price. I will revisit this later. If in a month or two you still can't get the cartridge, the rating will be one star.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4TT0RCQT8VK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,1,0,No,
RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",PBV-JSV,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R2558N1P0X0T8S,"March 15, 2020",Eric L.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Full Featured Networkable Printer,"The printer does not seem to come with a USB cable. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one on hand or buy one. Or at least mine didn’t come with any cables other than power. That was ok for me because I am using Ethernet and I have a bunch of spare Ethernet cables, and there is also wireless connectivity available. But USB likely the easiest way to get up and running for non-techies, so if this is you, have a spare printer cable lying around, or purchase one with the printer. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one or buy one.Once unpacked and set up following the crude pictograms included, it was necessary to download the drivers and install them. The unit does come with a CD installer disk, but even if you have an antique computer with an optical drive, it makes more sense to go to the Lexmark website and download the latest drivers. Who knows how old the ones on the CD are?After plugging the printer into my switch using Ethernet, and running the installer, the software could not find the printer, nor was it listed by my router as being connected (though the Ethernet activity lights on the printer were flashing). Eventually, I noticed that the small LCD display on the top of the printer had some questions about time, date, and language that must be answered on the printer before it will even show up on the network. After completing the setup on the small LCD screen, the printer was connected but the installer still could not find it. Instructions would have been helpful here, especially for people who aren’t technically inclined, but you can probably find help online.It was necessary for me to go to my router’s web page, get the printer’s DHCP provided IP address, and plug that into the installer manually in the “advanced set up” area. Also, it asks for you to manually type in the port name. I typed in “Ethernet” (no quotes) and it worked, the installer was able to proceed. After doing this on my main computer, I went back to the router and assigned a fixed IP address to the printer so that I will have no trouble finding it when I install the driver on my laptop and other computers.The software itself is nice and compact. I have a Canon printer that came with software that’s all up in your face all the time… meaning, it came with a bunch of bloatware like scrapbooking apps and card making apps and a bunch of docks and control panels that I had to carefully remove after writing the review. In the case of this Lexmark, it’s all business and it’s not in your face at all, and I appreciate that.The printer is fast and quiet. Over Ethernet, when I send a page the printer, it’s done printing before I can even start wondering how long it will take. Coming from an inkjet printer, this is really nice. Also, the network connectivity is indispensable these days. It certainly is if you have two or more devices in your life that you’d like to print from. That network connectivity also makes it easy to tweak the settings as the printer publishes a web page that you can reach from any web browser (if connected to from your local network). Just type the IP address of the printer into your browser and the settings page comes up. By the way, this is another good reason to assign a static IP to the printer; you can then just add a bookmark to your browser. That administrative web page allows you to change many parameters in several categories. Some of the settings are beyond my paltry comprehension, but there is a lot there that is useful to me, and some of it I’m sure is useful to IT personnel deploying these things on larger networks. There are a lot of IT tweaks and settings available here.The printer is handsome looking and compact, and it feels durable and professional. I think it will be perfect for my home office. Every computer I have can now print quickly and quietly from anywhere in the house.The unit comes with a toner cartridge that is described as a “starter cartridge.” It’s not clear to me how many pages we will get out of this; also, at the time of writing this, I couldn’t find replacement cartridges on Amazon or on the Lexmark site. No doubt they will be rolling these out soon; I just hope it’s sooner than my “starter cartridge” lasts. When available, I expect the replacement cartridges to cost well north of $100 each.I remember when laser printers cost a couple thousand dollars each, and then you had to pay extra for network connectivity. The price of this one is very appealing. In fact, it seems like a steal at this price. Just don’t forget that they get you on the toner, same as inkjet makers get you on the ink. There’s still no free lunch.Other than that, I’m delighted with this little printer.

RX72XBHQ26O0T,"March 16, 2020",Man in the Middle,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Very fast and works well. PC setup is easy. Mac setup is manual.,"The first thing I noticed on setting up this new printer is that it came with only one page of pictorial setup info, and no manual. It did include a driver CD, but my iMac running Catalina couldn't find any files it could run on that. In addition, searching the Lexmark website found no useful information about this new B3442dw model (though I did find a brochure about its likely predecessor, the B2442dw.)Fortunately, I was easily able to set the printer up properly anyway. Just remove all the packing materials both around the toner cartridge and on the outside of the case, load some paper, and power the printer on. A built-in small display will talk you through the needed initial settings, including entering a password to join your WiFi network. From there it was simple to tell my iMac to add a printer, and chose that one from the bonjour list that appeared. Once set up, its Options & Supplies button in the driver allows all other settings to be seen and customized easily.Since I do also have a Windows 10 laptop PC (Dell Inspiron XPS 15), I WAS quickly and easily able to install a driver on that, using the included CD.Once a driver was installed, printing on both the iMac and the Dell was a simple matter of choosing the Lexmark printer for a document. The result was blazingly fast (I've never seen such quick duplex printing before), and good quality.Overall, this is an excellent printer, lacking only a bit more attention to documentation to be fully ready for prime time on Macs in addition to Windows PCs.Update: Just discovered an interesting problem. For no obvious reason, the link to this printer at IP address 192.168.1.26 has also taken over the link to my Western Digital MyCloudEx2Ultra at IP address 192.168.1.2. Attempting to open a Web page at 192.168.1.2 shows the printer's web page, the same as if I'd opened the page at 192.168.1.26. And the MyCloud can't be accessed unless the printer is powered off. Those two addresses should NOT be in conflict, but somehow are. I'll update once I figure it out.Update 2: No toner is listed as available yet for this printer, either here at Amazon or at the maker's website. Whether the toner for the earlier model B2442dw would also work on this new model is unknown. The printer comes with a starter toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX72XBHQ26O0T?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R10V9WCIQS76AL,"March 14, 2020",Summit,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,FAST! Love it!,"This is a no-frills, monochrome printer without all the fancy touch-screen nonsense. What it does, it does perfectly- spit out paper quickly.I print a LOT while I'm working on some business plans, consulting and getting my MBA just for giggles despite being retired. My color laser eats toner as if it is free and it most certainly isn't. Having a monochrome, fast, two-sided printer as a default is the best idea ever... save that color printing for when it's actually necessary. It's surprising how often one does NOT need color, and the cost savings of not wasting printing in color is significant.I set this up without looking at directions, as I always do. Initially, it didn't detect ANY WiFi networks in my house when there are actually five of them. This was odd, but after several tries it started to see them. I had to go through typing the password through the simple buttons and simple display three times, but it finally connected and all is well.There is an app for this as well as computer software, but I chose to do everything without adding yet another app or yet another bit of software on my computer. It's likely far easier to do it with the apps etc- so unless you're just a glutton for punishment like me, just use their app.When it came time to print, this is when I became a big fan... it spits paper like crazy! I set it to print a large document, four pages per side, double sided... and wow, it was racing through it so much faster than any other printer I've had. SUPER fast at getting prints done. The print quality is fantastic, too. Double-sided printing saves SO much paper and space, too.Lexmark has always been one of my favorite printer suppliers, mostly known for their commercial machines. My last Lexmark was a color laser which was a complete disaster and never worked well at all. It ended up being recycled without ever having a successful print. Lexmark has redeemed themselves with this one- it's a business class machine that will absolutely STUN you with how fast it can put out pages. The ads say 42 pages per minute... which is faster than what I got, but plausible.Bravo, Lexmark. There are cheaper printers out there, but this one delivers performance that is worth every penny.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10V9WCIQS76AL?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively. Just be prepared to work though some issues with the initial setup.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EARTFHZLR1C9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R39CAVAUFNIBMI,"March 13, 2020",Stepinwolf,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"It works with wired ethernet, has safety mark, poor instructions","I had a little trouble setting this up. The instructions are graphical so that they work all the different languages worldwide. The first steps go through getting it out of the box, removing all the shipping tape and padding, putting paper in it and the like. At step 12, it basically says turn it on. Then in step 13 there is a picture of the CD and an arrow to a laptop. My laptop doesn’t have a CD drive. So I tried using it on a desktop Windows 10 PC and it couldn’t find the printer. I assume there was a missing step somewhere that was to allow the printer to access my local WiFi network. Since I have a wired ethernet as well as WiFi, I chose to make a wired connection so that I could go to the next step in the setup program. It did find the printer and that allowed me to go further. I did have to do a bit of troubleshooting to actually get it to print. I got some error message about something (SMTP?) not being set up. I kept trying to print and I thought it still wasn’t working until I went to the room where the printer was located and found that it had been printing and double sided at that. I seem to remember it asking me at some point if I used the wireless app to set up the printer. Since I didn’t have a wireless app that I was aware of, I said no. Notice in the lower right corner of the instructions there is an I with arrow pointing to a WWW for I assume information. Does this mean, if you need help search the web? A web might be helpful. On plus side, the printer works fine, with good print quality. I assume that I will get the wireless part working at some point.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39CAVAUFNIBMI?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
RU29785I48QOO,"March 18, 2020",LifeIsGood,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Speedy monochrome for the small or home office,"This compact laser printer (8 3/4"" H x 14"" W x 14"" D) does just one thing, but it does it very well. From sleep to first page out is under 10 seconds and pages print at the advertised speed, even using the duplexer, which I love. The picture instructions are bad, and there is nothing else, but once you get the printer out of the box they kind of make sense. This does not come with any cables other than power, so if you want to connect other than wirelessly you will need an Ethernet cable to connect to your network or a printer cable (with that squarish connector) to connect to your computer. I opted for wireless as I wanted to test this with my Android tablet as well. Once you power on the printer you have to use the 2-line monochrome screen to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that if you connect to a network it has to be 2G and not 5G. The driver for this is not on the Lexmark site as of this review, so I had to use the CD (I tried with the Windows driver and the pages printed like a negative, but the Lexmark software fixed that). The Lexmark app installed fine on my Android tablet (Samsung) and I was able to print from there as well. This is a no-frills B&W laser, but it is the best one I've ever used.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU29785I48QOO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
RO0E62GO6HF52,"March 31, 2020",C.G.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great option for home or small business owners who simply need a quick monochrome printer,"I've owned several Lexmark products over the years and I've never experienced any issues with any of them.This printer, while very simple compared to many printers on the market, is very nicely made, dependable, quick, and produces very high quality printed pages.Because of the simplicity of this being a printer only, set-up is little more than 10 minutes, max. I chose to connect via cord, but you have wireless options present.Printing speed, for me, hits 41 PPM. When I do speed print with this, every page is consistent in quality. No issues, of note.Sound wise, this isn't exactly a quiet printer, but it's not obnoxious, either.Overall footprint is quite small; this can easily be hidden if you so choose.Overall build quality and parts are very high. As I mentioned above, Lexmark makes great stuff and this printer is no different.In sum, this is a great option for the home or small business. It's a simply monochrome printer, but if that's all you need, this is a very good, viable, well situated option.I have no reservations recommending this printer.Recommended4 starsCheers!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO0E62GO6HF52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R2E0YW6BHGAOSB,"March 23, 2020",JoeInTampa,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast print from cold start, easy to set up.  Clean print.  Needs documentation.","This is a very nice monochrome laser printer. One I had previously took a long time to print from a cold start. This one begins to print almost as quiickly as an inkjet printer. Print quality is excellent and print speed is high. Wireless setup was very quick and easy. I like Lexmark's Unison toner. It separates the toner cartridge and the imaging unit unlike other toner cartridges where the units are combined. The Unison toner cartridge doesn't need shaking to equalize printing and prints at lower temperature than previous types of toner, so that means lower energy costs as well as quicker printing from a cold start. My only issue is probably due to this being a new item that I received through the Amazon Vine program. There is no online documentation specific to this model and I have been unable to determine the toner replacement cartridge for this unit. I assume that will change once this is a fully supported printer. All things considered, this is a great printer. My older laser printer is now history.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E0YW6BHGAOSB?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
