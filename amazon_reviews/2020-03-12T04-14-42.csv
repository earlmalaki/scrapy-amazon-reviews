RY11929L02OAT,"October 3, 2019",Orestes,1,MC3224adwe,N/A,Verified Purchase,15,2,Defective out of the box - poor warranty support,"This particular printer was defective when delivered. As soon as it was set up it was obvious that the print quality was very poor. After contacting Lexmark and sending examples and details (SN, proof of purchase etc) of the printer, the initial diagnosis was a faulty toner cartridge. A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience. Its possible that if you happen to get a working printer, it might serve you well. But don't count on much in the way of support from Lexmark if you happen to get a dud.",Yes,"We are very sorry for your recent experience and, in this case, applaud you for your patience and commitment in trying to fix your Lexmark purchase.  We have a highly skilled and experienced technical support center and strive for all of our customers to have an excellent experience at all times. Lexmark tracks the performance of our help desk and maintains a high level of responsiveness.  However, in this instance, we clearly failed.  I can only hope we can correct this situation for you in the future.  We appreciate your input and will look to this to help drive incremental improvements in our processes, response and timing in order to help you and any future customers resolve issues quickly and as painlessly as possible. "
R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,4,MC3224adwe,N/A,Vine Customer,31,0,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended.",No,
R218MLO8BAOX78,"November 8, 2019",MH,1,MC3224adwe,N/A,Verified Purchase,5,0,THIS PRINTER IS NOT USER FRIENDLY.,"The only things positive about a Lexmark MC3224adwe printer was its print quality and its physical construction (51 lbs). The printer was delivered without written support to setup this printer. Lexmark's online information is essentially meaningless. It was not only hard to understand, but it was vastly incomplete and misleading. After spending over 10 hours on the telephone with Lexmark's 3rd party contractor/support team, the technician got the printer to print properly. The technician could not get the scanner to function with the Lexmark information supplied to the 3rd party support team. The scanner worked after being ""jerry rigged"" by the technician with a non Lexmark product. Whoever designed Lexmark's software did not seem know what they were doing. The printer is built like a tank with the brain of a worm. I finally gave up and returned the printer to Amazon.",No,

RCWVYCEA8V2JZ,"November 9, 2019",Vizoere,4,MC3224adwe,N/A,Verified Purchase,1,0,"Good value, weak wifi, a bit complicated","I finally got it set up and working properly. I'm able to print from my two Windows-based computers and from my android phone. Document quality is superb, but photo quality is mediocre. I expected that when buying a laser, so no points off.I had several problems setting it up, most of which I think are due to a weak wifi radio. The printer is on the opposite end of the house from my router with walls, cabinets, a refrigerator between them. That said, other devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc) work ok in this office.When turning on the printer for the first time, the screen showed a message telling me to go to a specific URL and download the Lexmark software for my mobile device to help set up the printer. I just went to the Google Play store and searched for Lexmark Mobile Assistant, and it came right up. Installed that and started the configuration. It seemed a bit complicated, but ended up working fine to configure the printer.Within the app, it suggested downloading the Lexmark printing app and the Lexmark print plugin. I did both and tried to print a picture from my phone. That's where the problems started. It would fail to connect, then connect ok long enough to send a print, then it couldn't connect anymore.I switched to setting up the Windows computers, downloaded the software from Lexmark (skipped using the CD, as they're usually out-of-date), and started the install. It couldn't locate the printer on the network, and after several tries using a couple of the options, I just clicked the Advanced button, typed in the IP address manually, and the install finished. Once that was finished, Windows could print and the printer spit out the paper with what I expected, but every time, I saw a message pop up that it couldn't connect to the printer.Eventually, after troubleshooting and searching Google, I decided to try plugging it in through an ethernet cable instead of worrying with wifi. After changing the Windows printer port to reflect the new IP address, I stopped getting the can't connect error. After deleting and re-adding the printer on my phone, it can now print as well.Overall, I'm happy with the printer, as it has the features I need for a reasonable price. As an IT person, I was able to work through the difficulties caused by the weak wifi radio, but I don't know that someone not familiar with networking would have been able to without assistance.",No,

I was really disappointed.,Yes,"We are thrilled that you loved your purchase of the MC3224adwe.  Our team of engineers do their best to support a large range of product types, weights and sizes but in this case, the cardstock you needed wasn't one of them.  Often our help desk at 1-800-Lexmark can provide different media suggestions, allowing more flexibility from your product.  We would also like to recommend that if that media type is absolutely necessary our MC2425adw does support heavier media types, like cardstock. "
R32V7NI6AHJEES,"December 12, 2019",D. Lebow,5,MC3224adwe,N/A,Verified Purchase,1,0,"Impressive printer, works great with macOS!","This is a really good little color laser multifunction printer. I’m on macOS and I was wary of a few negative reviews about the lack of Apple software for this unit, but I have a friend who is a Lexmark dealer and authorized repair center, so I thought it was worth the risk.It’s true that there is no Mac driver for this unit, but you don’t need it. Unpacking and setting up was easy… And using the free Lexmark iOS app to set up my Wi-Fi connection couldn’t have been simpler. My Mac Pro saw the printer instantly and I was up and running in two minutes.And while there is no Lexmark software to run this printer… I already owned VueScan, A third-party scanning software… And it runs this printer perfectly, including all of the options for resolution, flatbed scanning, document feeder scanning, and everything else. You can also access all of the printers options through your web browser by locating the printers address on your home network.So… Absolutely a joy to set up and use with my Mac Pro running Mojave.",No,
