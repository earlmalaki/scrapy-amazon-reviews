I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away.

The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying.

RRBP7OITNW73Q,"August 11, 2019",socrchik2000,4,7,Scan solution?,"<span>After reading the reviews that talked about the SMTP problems and scanning problems and setup, I just wanted to put my 2cents in.  I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking.  I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome.  However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work.  Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error.  I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message!  The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now.</span>"

This copier is completely worthless.  I thought Lexmark was a good brand.  I have a Lexmark printer I have used for several years.  Very happy with it.  I had to set up the HP printer that I was replacing with this Lexmark just so I could scan in a page and fax.  If I could return this product I would!</span>"

Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.<br><br>CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.<br><br>It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download  a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.<br><br>The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.<br><br>The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.<br><br>All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience.</span>"

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option."

R2LSKMKUGRULUU,"July 27, 2019",CNH,4,"Great printer, worth the price.  Monochrome","I originally got this for my kids to use -- school projects are going to bankrupt me -- but I've been so impressed that this has become my main default printer. It will print, copy, scan and fax. Setup was simple for me -- driver update and off we go . . . and I found that it did all the things it was supposed to easily. It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser. The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall). The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning. I miss that more than I thought I would. It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that. I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color. And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain. Two line scrolling menu to control the printer? SHEESH. Horribly cumbersome. BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again. Oh, and the smtp error. That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother. That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit. For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk. But is is worth considering before you commit."
R3DRARC2UN4FLX,"July 13, 2019",Sagewood,4,"Great printer, but prints only in black and white","This printer is really awesome and easy to set-up in few minutes with very little help and guide from the instruction manual. Though I think the set- up was relatively easy for me because I have a lot of experience with printers and electronic gadgets and may not be so easy for a newbie to set-up.I ordered this Laser printer because my old one does not as efficiently I would like (very slow). This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids. Overall this is a great printer for the price point, but I wish it had option for color printing."
R5XZE153QXCEF,"August 2, 2019",Thinker3,3,"Great printer, if you can get it to work for you","This printer does all of the jobs it should do quite well. If you can get it to print, it prints well and quickly. If you can get it to scan, it scans well and quickly. And so on. The difficulty is getting the printer to do its jobs. The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text). Since getting the printer, I have been using it by connecting the USB, as getting wireless printing to work every time is a chore.Without the other reviewer's comments, I would never have gotten rid of the error that reminds you to set up SMTP. Actually setting up SMTP has proved beyond my capabilities.The printer also takes a fair bit of time to start up, and it needs to be restarted quite often as its OS locks up if it's left alone.Overall, it's a good printer if you don't mind hooking up the usb every time you want to use it."
R2KO3L8R22WLRR,"July 17, 2019",Theresa H,3,Installation could be simplified,The printer is awesome! The installation not so much. It needs better direction. It should not be this discombobulated to hook this thing up. It prints perfectly though so that's a plus.

RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,3,6,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights"," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."
RRBP7OITNW73Q,"August 11, 2019",socrchik2000,4,1,Scan solution?,"After reading the reviews that talked about the SMTP problems and scanning problems and setup, I just wanted to put my 2cents in. I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking. I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome. However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work. Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error. I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message! The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now."
R38XVXQLFG62H6,"August 12, 2019",Elaine N.,1,0,Don't waste your money,"This product is HORRIBLE!! Although it makes wonderful copies and prints great if you are printing something computer generated, I can't figure out how to scan in a page or how to send a fax. This copier is completely worthless. I thought Lexmark was a good brand. I have a Lexmark printer I have used for several years. Very happy with it. I had to set up the HP printer that I was replacing with this Lexmark just so I could scan in a page and fax. If I could return this product I would!"
RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,4,0,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.","PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."
R2TJU4SF8JIXJK,"February 22, 2020",Kelly Pfister,4,0,Lexmark MB2236,"I like the printer, however I found out after the fact that there is no local scan to PC option and scanning must be done via the cloud.

Update 2/27/20 I figured out that this will scan to your local PC if you use Windows Fax and Scan.

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,0,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents.

It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser. The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall). The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning. I miss that more than I thought I would. It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that. I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color. And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain. Two line scrolling menu to control the printer? SHEESH. Horribly cumbersome. BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again. Oh, and the smtp error. That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother. That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit. For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk. But is is worth considering before you commit."
R3DRARC2UN4FLX,"July 13, 2019",Sagewood,4,0,"Great printer, but prints only in black and white","This printer is really awesome and easy to set-up in few minutes with very little help and guide from the instruction manual. Though I think the set- up was relatively easy for me because I have a lot of experience with printers and electronic gadgets and may not be so easy for a newbie to set-up.I ordered this Laser printer because my old one does not as efficiently I would like (very slow). This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids. Overall this is a great printer for the price point, but I wish it had option for color printing."
R5XZE153QXCEF,"August 2, 2019",Thinker3,3,0,"Great printer, if you can get it to work for you","This printer does all of the jobs it should do quite well. If you can get it to print, it prints well and quickly. If you can get it to scan, it scans well and quickly. And so on. The difficulty is getting the printer to do its jobs. The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text). Since getting the printer, I have been using it by connecting the USB, as getting wireless printing to work every time is a chore.Without the other reviewer's comments, I would never have gotten rid of the error that reminds you to set up SMTP. Actually setting up SMTP has proved beyond my capabilities.The printer also takes a fair bit of time to start up, and it needs to be restarted quite often as its OS locks up if it's left alone.Overall, it's a good printer if you don't mind hooking up the usb every time you want to use it."

It does everything the big boys do and works just fine for our small office. I suspect if we used a lot more we would need more bells and whistles but it's not necessary right now. The thing we use most is the scan to email and it does it quick and allows us to send off contracts pretty quickly!

When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."

I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,4 people found this helpful,0,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option."

Prints quickly with high quality imaging. Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular.

When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."
RRBP7OITNW73Q,"August 11, 2019",socrchik2000,4,,Verified Purchase,7 people found this helpful,1,Scan solution?,"After reading the reviews that talked about the SMTP problems and scanning problems and setup, I just wanted to put my 2cents in. I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking. I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome. However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work. Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error. I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message! The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now."

RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,4,,Verified Purchase,3 people found this helpful,0,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.","PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,,Vine Customer,4 people found this helpful,0,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option."

Prints quickly with high quality imaging. Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular. I pay around 1/2 a cent for the ink for each page on my black and white Brother... although sometimes it isn't as nice and crispy as it should be."

When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark.

The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light.

RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,4,,Verified Purchase,3,0,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.","PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."
R2TJU4SF8JIXJK,"February 22, 2020",Kelly Pfister,4,,Verified Purchase,1,0,Lexmark MB2236,"I like the printer, however I found out after the fact that there is no local scan to PC option and scanning must be done via the cloud. Had I know this, I would have picked a different all-in-one. That being said, I like how this one prints and the fact that it prints double sided. It is also easy to make copies. Update 2/27/20 I figured out that this will scan to your local PC if you use Windows Fax and Scan. Also, there are some open source software scanners that will also allow you to scan on your local PC. I am using NAPS2 and it works great with this."

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,,Vine Customer,4,0,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option."
R3LW0NN16FHC9M,"November 1, 2019",Theresa J.,1,,Unverified,5,0,Scanner functionlity,"Looks good and reads well on Amazon, however this printer is dysfunctional for everyday use. There is no USB port to print to and for scanning you have to open an application even though the printer key pad option actually have a scan prompt cability. When you use that function, it gives you a hard copy of the document. The technical support team lacks the knowledge about the printer functionalities. In fact when they cannot answer a practical question they lie instead. One tech by the name Yury Alexandra Espinosa Piratoba was very dishonest about calling me back.... still waiting. The case number she gave to me does not exit according to another tech support member. The chat request gives an error after submitting"
R369M0HXD51CGA,"July 12, 2019",CorpGovNet,4,,Vine Customer,1,0,"OEM Refills Only, Since New Model: Setup Difficult","This is a great quality printer. Prints quickly with high quality imaging. Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular. I pay around 1/2 a cent for the ink for each page on my black and white Brother... although sometimes it isn't as nice and crispy as it should be."
R1EYFMTU3OCMLZ,"June 29, 2019",dan rossi,4,,Vine Customer,1,0,Setup is a bear.,"When i got this in i immediately unboxed and tryed to set it up. When i turned it on the screen it asked with or without disc, now i have nothing in my house that takes a disc so i went for using the app. Well the app is useless, the screen gives u a id to type in which doesn't exist in the app so i decided to use the scan the back of the unit option. It scanned, told me it didnt see it. I had to download a different app other then the one that it told me to use.So there is the print app and a mobile assistance app that sees your wifi network. It seemed to work untill i hit print and only heard the rollers spin, then nothing. In order for me to get it to work i had to plug in my either net cable. Also if it wasnt for another reviewer i would have never figured how to get rid of the red blinking light.Now that it's hardwired and my phone and laptop see it the unit works great. It prints fast and scans fast. I just need to plug my phone jack in to try the fax out.Just beware if this is in your house u will most likely have some issues getting it up and running."
RO5E9LDMF155E,"July 4, 2019",@TrevorHikes,4,,Vine Customer,2,0,"Painful Setup, Great Printing",I've set up a lot of printers over the years and overall wireless printer setup can be tough but this printer's wireless setup process is horrible and in my case - impossible. The app they have you download could never find the printer. Luckily I had a CAT-5 cable already set up so I chose that method and was up and running quickly. I also had trouble loading the paper the first time. Luckily my wife figured it out. So the best advice I have is to make sure there is someone smart nearby. Print quality and speed are fantastic.
R2LSKMKUGRULUU,"July 27, 2019",CNH,4,,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, worth the price.  Monochrome","I originally got this for my kids to use -- school projects are going to bankrupt me -- but I've been so impressed that this has become my main default printer. It will print, copy, scan and fax. Setup was simple for me -- driver update and off we go . . . and I found that it did all the things it was supposed to easily. It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser. The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall). The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning. I miss that more than I thought I would. It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that. I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color. And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain. Two line scrolling menu to control the printer? SHEESH. Horribly cumbersome. BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again. Oh, and the smtp error. That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother. That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit. For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk. But is is worth considering before you commit."
R3DRARC2UN4FLX,"July 13, 2019",Sagewood,4,,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, but prints only in black and white","This printer is really awesome and easy to set-up in few minutes with very little help and guide from the instruction manual. Though I think the set- up was relatively easy for me because I have a lot of experience with printers and electronic gadgets and may not be so easy for a newbie to set-up.I ordered this Laser printer because my old one does not as efficiently I would like (very slow). This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids. Overall this is a great printer for the price point, but I wish it had option for color printing."
R5XZE153QXCEF,"August 2, 2019",Thinker3,3,,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, if you can get it to work for you","This printer does all of the jobs it should do quite well. If you can get it to print, it prints well and quickly. If you can get it to scan, it scans well and quickly. And so on. The difficulty is getting the printer to do its jobs. The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text). Since getting the printer, I have been using it by connecting the USB, as getting wireless printing to work every time is a chore.Without the other reviewer's comments, I would never have gotten rid of the error that reminds you to set up SMTP. Actually setting up SMTP has proved beyond my capabilities.The printer also takes a fair bit of time to start up, and it needs to be restarted quite often as its OS locks up if it's left alone.Overall, it's a good printer if you don't mind hooking up the usb every time you want to use it."

There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."

R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ,"July 29, 2019",Just Plain Larry,3,N/A,Vine Customer,111,1,3 stars and I'll explain in the review WHY only 3,"===Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.===Review begins:Just a heads up since some people may miss this. Monochrome= black and white printing ONLY. This is NOT a color laser printerThis has the POTENTIAL to be a great printer but there are several things that caused me to deduct pointsPROS:1. Good print speed. I did a 50 page double sided document in less than 2 minutes.2. 3 ways to connect. Wireless, Ethernet or USB3. Good scanning speed. I scanned a 20 page document in 40 seconds. And it WILL scan to a color document, it just won't PRINT in color.4. Compact and lightweight. At 16.5"" W x 13"" D x 14"" high it will fit almost anywhere. And at 16 pounds weight, it is a breeze to carry around. If you are old school like me, and you remember the early lasers that required 2 men, a horse and a hoist to put in place, you will appreciate the lightweight of this product5. Automatic Duplex Printing. You don't have to wait for it to print the odd numbered pages, and then reload the first prints for the even numbered pages. It automatically pulls the sheet back and prints the second side6. 250 page paper tray. Not nearly as much paper loading. And it handles letter and LEGAL size easily.6. At 5% toner lay down, you get crisp clear sharp text.7. Starter cartridge included.8. Built-n Web Server so you can check on status, jobs, level of supplies etc.9. It's multi-function so you can fax, scan, copy or print.10. When it's done for the day, it takes you out to dinner. OK not really, but it does a lot of things.So with all that, why only 3 stars you ask?1. The setup guide is a pictograph, not text.2. There is no manual included in the box or on the CD. I can understand not including a 187 page manual on paper, but they could have at least included the manual in PDF format on the CD. I had to go to support.lexmark.com to get the manual.3. It has a separate imaging unit from the toner cartridge. The unit is rated for 12,000 pages. We don't usually print that much in a year, but what about folks who print 3,000 pages a month? Every 4 months you will have to replace the imaging unit.4. And now, My BIGGEST gripe about this product. TONER COST!!!!!!!! Unless you are willing to participate in their Return program, which means you buy the cartridge and only use it once you can expect to pay $275-$350 for an extra high yield cartridge (6,000 pages) and from $90-$150 for a regular cartridge (1,200 pages) . And even on the return program for a regular yield (1,200 pages) they start at $48 depending on where you shop for it.Between having to replace toner, and having an external imaging unit, I don't care that it takes you out for dinner (again, just kidding). The operating costs for this product are too high for every day usage except in a small office. I was hoping to retire my old HP 1020, but that isn't going to happen until the consumable costs come way down. This printer is a fairly new release, so it is hard to find remanufactured consumables yet.So if you can overlook the consumables cost, then this is a good printer for daily use, even if it is not economical to use. The output is clear and sharp. Scanner works great. I did not test the fax since our fax server is in another room from the printer. Fast printing. Fast scanning. Wi-Fi enabled. Mid-point price range. Ethernet ready. USB Front port for printing from a flash drive. Network capable. USB Ready as well. Color control panel that's large enough to work with. Compact design and weight.But I am still only giving it 3 stars for the consumables cost.End of Review===Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

R7J71FM6H53QM,"October 1, 2019",Ideal One,1,N/A,Verified Purchase,17,1,Do Not Purchase,I purchased this Lexmark to my utter disappointment. There is no manual on how to set it up. There was no drivers included in the box. When I tried to scan a document the scanning feature required a password that was not provided nor could I reprogram. I went online to watch videos on how to install drivers and how to install the intitial settings. The only video on youtube or on Lexmark's website was how to remove the tape from the printer. This unbelievable. I cannot believe how stupid I was trying to save 50.00. If I live to be 150 years old I will never by a Lexmark product again. I feel humiliated by buying this product.
R3W1ED6Z48GYGV,"August 31, 2019",MeWa,3,N/A,Verified Purchase,5,0,"Auto duplex print, not scan. Need CD drive to load drivers","Good home office MFC monochrome laser printer. Does what is expected, with two caveats:1. Missing auto-duplex ADF scanning - the scanner document feeder will only scan one side and then the paper must be re-fed after flipping over. Not sure why you would even make an ADF without auto-duplex, it kills your efficiency.2. Windows 10 drivers need to be loaded from enclosed CD. They are not built in to Windows (like every other printer that I have ever had), and not easy to find on the Lexmark website. If your computer does not have a CD drive, think twice before getting this printer."

RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,3,N/A,Verified Purchase,57,6,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights"," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."
RRBP7OITNW73Q,"August 11, 2019",socrchik2000,4,N/A,Verified Purchase,7,1,Scan solution?,"After reading the reviews that talked about the SMTP problems and scanning problems and setup, I just wanted to put my 2cents in. I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking. I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome. However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work. Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error. I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message! The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now."

Although it makes wonderful copies and prints great if you are printing something computer generated, I can't figure out how to scan in a page or how to send a fax. This copier is completely worthless. I thought Lexmark was a good brand. I have a Lexmark printer I have used for several years. Very happy with it. I had to set up the HP printer that I was replacing with this Lexmark just so I could scan in a page and fax. If I could return this product I would!"
RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,4,N/A,Verified Purchase,3,0,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.","PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer.

R1CFP7Y6DEZ204,"August 25, 2019",Keogh,5,N/A,Vine Customer,7,0,Excellent printer,"The Lexmark MB2236adwe is a very good printer with a few blips that aren't excessively detrimental. I use it regularly everyday with complete satisfaction.Packaging is quite good with a foam shell encasing the printer, all movable components are thoroughly secured with tape and the entire bundle covered in a plastic bag. The included instruction booklet is a little minimalist and it does not come with a printer cable. Most annoying is actually the included software CD, I haven't used discs in over a decade and all my rigs are custom built so the disc is useless and the online support site is not friendly for support. The adwe version of the MB2236 is not actively supported at this time and checking the other versions only provided a driver for 1 of them, no software at all. I noticed the CD said G4 lexmark software and a quick search found me a downloadable version that works perfectly but for some reason it's not on the MB2236 support pages.Setup is a little rough depending on your networking capabilities. I hoped for a more user friendly setup. I've been building my own computers for 20 years and while networking is not my strong point I'm not a complete novice. The flexibility with this unit means there's tons of options to deal with and the unit didn't come plug n' play, it had to have the network setup to connect wirelessly and I found the G4 software was necessary for regular, continuous use. Just the driver installed allowed me to print initially but afterwards, say after restarting, the printer wouldn't auto connect or even register as online/available. With the G4 software I can print whenever without issue.Print quality is excellent, the printer is quite capable and does 2 sided printing with ease even from the copy function. Copy quality is good and overall speed is pretty good. I set the unit to wake, print, go back to sleep and it does so flawlessly. I have noticed the noise it makes while printing is a little clunky, while the printer performs admirably and professionally, that noise makes it sound a bit on the cheap and flimsy side though nothing else about it instills those feelings.Lastly, the ink cartridges are on the expensive side. I have bought many toner cartridges for most of the major brands and this one is about twice the cost of the equivalent version of the brand I use at work. Overall, once you get past the setup hurdles it's a great printer that does a lot of stuff and does them well. I am a long time fan of Lexmark, having never had problems with them and appreciating the quality. I am not disappointed with this unit at all, I wish the ink was more in-line cost wise with other brands but it's a solid product that I'm glad I ordered."

R1IMHTZMA01DA1,"July 21, 2019",Mark Y,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,Feature packed multi-purpose machine,"This Lexmark is a powerhouse for any small or home office. I've set it up in home home office where I am constantly printing and faxing documents throughout the day. The machine was pretty simple to get setup on my WiFi network using the Lexmark Mobile setup app available on apple and android. I suggest using the app as it's much easier than typing on the small touchscreen.The touchscreen responds quickly and is visually appealing. It can be customized with most frequently used features such as scan, fax and email. PC drivers and software was easy to install and had no issues setting up on my 2 laptops and my desktop. I can seamlessly print from all of my devices and applications.Faxing is a breeze using the top loading self feeder tray. Once the fax task is complete the machine prints out a fax log which includes your cover page (or whatever your first page was) along with the status, time, page count and number sent to.Scanning can be done from the auto feeder tray or the flat panel (I prefer the auto feeder). Print quality is outstanding, crisp clear printing every time and super fast. I formerly used an ink-jet all in one and printing took forever. The only downside I've noticed is with scanning files to a PC or mobile device. My previous machine I could put my documents into the feeder, sit at my desk and just scan to my computer or mobile device. After scanning I could tweak if needed, send as email etc.With this Lexmark when you scan from a PC or mobile device it makes you ""approve"" the job on the printer itself which to me defeats the purpose of scanning from my PC if I have to go back to the printer to OK the scan. Something I hope a software or firmware patch can fix.Overall This multi-function laser printer is a great investment and makes daily tasks much faster without reducing quality."

It’s also secure and keeps your information safe.Another feature is faxing and when your faxing is done it prints out a log with your cover page showing the status of your fax along with the time, date, how many pages, and the number where it was sent.The printer itself is quite clear. I just wish I had paid more attention and it had been a color printer."

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,N/A,Vine Customer,4,0,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option."
R3LW0NN16FHC9M,"November 1, 2019",Theresa J.,1,N/A,Unverified,5,0,Scanner functionlity,"Looks good and reads well on Amazon, however this printer is dysfunctional for everyday use. There is no USB port to print to and for scanning you have to open an application even though the printer key pad option actually have a scan prompt cability. When you use that function, it gives you a hard copy of the document. The technical support team lacks the knowledge about the printer functionalities. In fact when they cannot answer a practical question they lie instead. One tech by the name Yury Alexandra Espinosa Piratoba was very dishonest about calling me back.... still waiting. The case number she gave to me does not exit according to another tech support member. The chat request gives an error after submitting"
R369M0HXD51CGA,"July 12, 2019",CorpGovNet,4,N/A,Vine Customer,1,0,"OEM Refills Only, Since New Model: Setup Difficult","This is a great quality printer. Prints quickly with high quality imaging. Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular. I pay around 1/2 a cent for the ink for each page on my black and white Brother... although sometimes it isn't as nice and crispy as it should be."
R1EYFMTU3OCMLZ,"June 29, 2019",dan rossi,4,N/A,Vine Customer,1,0,Setup is a bear.,"When i got this in i immediately unboxed and tryed to set it up. When i turned it on the screen it asked with or without disc, now i have nothing in my house that takes a disc so i went for using the app. Well the app is useless, the screen gives u a id to type in which doesn't exist in the app so i decided to use the scan the back of the unit option. It scanned, told me it didnt see it. I had to download a different app other then the one that it told me to use.So there is the print app and a mobile assistance app that sees your wifi network. It seemed to work untill i hit print and only heard the rollers spin, then nothing. In order for me to get it to work i had to plug in my either net cable. Also if it wasnt for another reviewer i would have never figured how to get rid of the red blinking light.Now that it's hardwired and my phone and laptop see it the unit works great. It prints fast and scans fast. I just need to plug my phone jack in to try the fax out.Just beware if this is in your house u will most likely have some issues getting it up and running."
RO5E9LDMF155E,"July 4, 2019",@TrevorHikes,4,N/A,Vine Customer,2,0,"Painful Setup, Great Printing",I've set up a lot of printers over the years and overall wireless printer setup can be tough but this printer's wireless setup process is horrible and in my case - impossible. The app they have you download could never find the printer. Luckily I had a CAT-5 cable already set up so I chose that method and was up and running quickly. I also had trouble loading the paper the first time. Luckily my wife figured it out. So the best advice I have is to make sure there is someone smart nearby. Print quality and speed are fantastic.
R2LSKMKUGRULUU,"July 27, 2019",CNH,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, worth the price.  Monochrome","I originally got this for my kids to use -- school projects are going to bankrupt me -- but I've been so impressed that this has become my main default printer. It will print, copy, scan and fax. Setup was simple for me -- driver update and off we go . . . and I found that it did all the things it was supposed to easily. It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser. The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall). The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning. I miss that more than I thought I would. It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that. I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color. And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain. Two line scrolling menu to control the printer? SHEESH. Horribly cumbersome. BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again. Oh, and the smtp error. That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother. That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit. For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk. But is is worth considering before you commit."
R3DRARC2UN4FLX,"July 13, 2019",Sagewood,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, but prints only in black and white","This printer is really awesome and easy to set-up in few minutes with very little help and guide from the instruction manual. Though I think the set- up was relatively easy for me because I have a lot of experience with printers and electronic gadgets and may not be so easy for a newbie to set-up.I ordered this Laser printer because my old one does not as efficiently I would like (very slow). This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids. Overall this is a great printer for the price point, but I wish it had option for color printing."
R5XZE153QXCEF,"August 2, 2019",Thinker3,3,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, if you can get it to work for you","This printer does all of the jobs it should do quite well. If you can get it to print, it prints well and quickly. If you can get it to scan, it scans well and quickly. And so on. The difficulty is getting the printer to do its jobs. The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text). Since getting the printer, I have been using it by connecting the USB, as getting wireless printing to work every time is a chore.Without the other reviewer's comments, I would never have gotten rid of the error that reminds you to set up SMTP. Actually setting up SMTP has proved beyond my capabilities.The printer also takes a fair bit of time to start up, and it needs to be restarted quite often as its OS locks up if it's left alone.Overall, it's a good printer if you don't mind hooking up the usb every time you want to use it."

R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ,"July 29, 2019",Just Plain Larry,3,N/A,Vine Customer,111,1,3 stars and I'll explain in the review WHY only 3,"===Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.===Review begins:Just a heads up since some people may miss this. Monochrome= black and white printing ONLY. This is NOT a color laser printerThis has the POTENTIAL to be a great printer but there are several things that caused me to deduct pointsPROS:1. Good print speed. I did a 50 page double sided document in less than 2 minutes.2. 3 ways to connect. Wireless, Ethernet or USB3. Good scanning speed. I scanned a 20 page document in 40 seconds. And it WILL scan to a color document, it just won't PRINT in color.4. Compact and lightweight. At 16.5"" W x 13"" D x 14"" high it will fit almost anywhere. And at 16 pounds weight, it is a breeze to carry around. If you are old school like me, and you remember the early lasers that required 2 men, a horse and a hoist to put in place, you will appreciate the lightweight of this product5. Automatic Duplex Printing. You don't have to wait for it to print the odd numbered pages, and then reload the first prints for the even numbered pages. It automatically pulls the sheet back and prints the second side6. 250 page paper tray. Not nearly as much paper loading. And it handles letter and LEGAL size easily.6. At 5% toner lay down, you get crisp clear sharp text.7. Starter cartridge included.8. Built-n Web Server so you can check on status, jobs, level of supplies etc.9. It's multi-function so you can fax, scan, copy or print.10. When it's done for the day, it takes you out to dinner. OK not really, but it does a lot of things.So with all that, why only 3 stars you ask?1. The setup guide is a pictograph, not text.2. There is no manual included in the box or on the CD. I can understand not including a 187 page manual on paper, but they could have at least included the manual in PDF format on the CD. I had to go to support.lexmark.com to get the manual.3. It has a separate imaging unit from the toner cartridge. The unit is rated for 12,000 pages. We don't usually print that much in a year, but what about folks who print 3,000 pages a month? Every 4 months you will have to replace the imaging unit.4. And now, My BIGGEST gripe about this product. TONER COST!!!!!!!! Unless you are willing to participate in their Return program, which means you buy the cartridge and only use it once you can expect to pay $275-$350 for an extra high yield cartridge (6,000 pages) and from $90-$150 for a regular cartridge (1,200 pages) . And even on the return program for a regular yield (1,200 pages) they start at $48 depending on where you shop for it.Between having to replace toner, and having an external imaging unit, I don't care that it takes you out for dinner (again, just kidding). The operating costs for this product are too high for every day usage except in a small office. I was hoping to retire my old HP 1020, but that isn't going to happen until the consumable costs come way down. This printer is a fairly new release, so it is hard to find remanufactured consumables yet.So if you can overlook the consumables cost, then this is a good printer for daily use, even if it is not economical to use. The output is clear and sharp. Scanner works great. I did not test the fax since our fax server is in another room from the printer. Fast printing. Fast scanning. Wi-Fi enabled. Mid-point price range. Ethernet ready. USB Front port for printing from a flash drive. Network capable. USB Ready as well. Color control panel that's large enough to work with. Compact design and weight.But I am still only giving it 3 stars for the consumables cost.End of Review===Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

There was no drivers included in the box. When I tried to scan a document the scanning feature required a password that was not provided nor could I reprogram. I went online to watch videos on how to install drivers and how to install the intitial settings. The only video on youtube or on Lexmark's website was how to remove the tape from the printer. This unbelievable. I cannot believe how stupid I was trying to save 50.00. If I live to be 150 years old I will never by a Lexmark product again. I feel humiliated by buying this product.

Does what is expected, with two caveats:1. Missing auto-duplex ADF scanning - the scanner document feeder will only scan one side and then the paper must be re-fed after flipping over. Not sure why you would even make an ADF without auto-duplex, it kills your efficiency.2. Windows 10 drivers need to be loaded from enclosed CD. They are not built in to Windows (like every other printer that I have ever had), and not easy to find on the Lexmark website.

When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."
RRBP7OITNW73Q,"August 11, 2019",socrchik2000,4,N/A,Verified Purchase,7,1,Scan solution?,"After reading the reviews that talked about the SMTP problems and scanning problems and setup, I just wanted to put my 2cents in. I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking. I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome. However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work. Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error. I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message! The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now."

I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."
R2TJU4SF8JIXJK,"February 22, 2020",Kelly Pfister,4,N/A,Verified Purchase,1,0,Lexmark MB2236,"I like the printer, however I found out after the fact that there is no local scan to PC option and scanning must be done via the cloud. Had I know this, I would have picked a different all-in-one. That being said, I like how this one prints and the fact that it prints double sided. It is also easy to make copies. Update 2/27/20 I figured out that this will scan to your local PC if you use Windows Fax and Scan. Also, there are some open source software scanners that will also allow you to scan on your local PC. I am using NAPS2 and it works great with this."

R1CFP7Y6DEZ204,"August 25, 2019",Keogh,5,N/A,Vine Customer,7,0,Excellent printer,"The Lexmark MB2236adwe is a very good printer with a few blips that aren't excessively detrimental. I use it regularly everyday with complete satisfaction.Packaging is quite good with a foam shell encasing the printer, all movable components are thoroughly secured with tape and the entire bundle covered in a plastic bag. The included instruction booklet is a little minimalist and it does not come with a printer cable. Most annoying is actually the included software CD, I haven't used discs in over a decade and all my rigs are custom built so the disc is useless and the online support site is not friendly for support. The adwe version of the MB2236 is not actively supported at this time and checking the other versions only provided a driver for 1 of them, no software at all. I noticed the CD said G4 lexmark software and a quick search found me a downloadable version that works perfectly but for some reason it's not on the MB2236 support pages.Setup is a little rough depending on your networking capabilities. I hoped for a more user friendly setup. I've been building my own computers for 20 years and while networking is not my strong point I'm not a complete novice. The flexibility with this unit means there's tons of options to deal with and the unit didn't come plug n' play, it had to have the network setup to connect wirelessly and I found the G4 software was necessary for regular, continuous use. Just the driver installed allowed me to print initially but afterwards, say after restarting, the printer wouldn't auto connect or even register as online/available. With the G4 software I can print whenever without issue.Print quality is excellent, the printer is quite capable and does 2 sided printing with ease even from the copy function. Copy quality is good and overall speed is pretty good. I set the unit to wake, print, go back to sleep and it does so flawlessly. I have noticed the noise it makes while printing is a little clunky, while the printer performs admirably and professionally, that noise makes it sound a bit on the cheap and flimsy side though nothing else about it instills those feelings.Lastly, the ink cartridges are on the expensive side. I have bought many toner cartridges for most of the major brands and this one is about twice the cost of the equivalent version of the brand I use at work. Overall, once you get past the setup hurdles it's a great printer that does a lot of stuff and does them well. I am a long time fan of Lexmark, having never had problems with them and appreciating the quality. I am not disappointed with this unit at all, I wish the ink was more in-line cost wise with other brands but it's a solid product that I'm glad I ordered."

R1IMHTZMA01DA1,"July 21, 2019",Mark Y,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,Feature packed multi-purpose machine,"This Lexmark is a powerhouse for any small or home office. I've set it up in home home office where I am constantly printing and faxing documents throughout the day. The machine was pretty simple to get setup on my WiFi network using the Lexmark Mobile setup app available on apple and android. I suggest using the app as it's much easier than typing on the small touchscreen.The touchscreen responds quickly and is visually appealing. It can be customized with most frequently used features such as scan, fax and email. PC drivers and software was easy to install and had no issues setting up on my 2 laptops and my desktop. I can seamlessly print from all of my devices and applications.Faxing is a breeze using the top loading self feeder tray. Once the fax task is complete the machine prints out a fax log which includes your cover page (or whatever your first page was) along with the status, time, page count and number sent to.Scanning can be done from the auto feeder tray or the flat panel (I prefer the auto feeder). Print quality is outstanding, crisp clear printing every time and super fast. I formerly used an ink-jet all in one and printing took forever. The only downside I've noticed is with scanning files to a PC or mobile device. My previous machine I could put my documents into the feeder, sit at my desk and just scan to my computer or mobile device. After scanning I could tweak if needed, send as email etc.With this Lexmark when you scan from a PC or mobile device it makes you ""approve"" the job on the printer itself which to me defeats the purpose of scanning from my PC if I have to go back to the printer to OK the scan. Something I hope a software or firmware patch can fix.Overall This multi-function laser printer is a great investment and makes daily tasks much faster without reducing quality."

I didn’t think about what Monochrome meant I just saw Color Touch Screen and thought it was a color printer. Its not, but it is a very sharp black ink printer. So now here is everything else that is wonderful about this machine.It’s small enough to fit comfortably on a desk. It prints on both sides, scans, faxes, copies, and sends. The tray capacity is up to 250 pages plus it has a single sheet feeder. It’s wireless so that you can call it from your mobile devices like your tablet or smart phone. USB or Ethernet connectivity is also available. It’s also secure and keeps your information safe.Another feature is faxing and when your faxing is done it prints out a log with your cover page showing the status of your fax along with the time, date, how many pages, and the number where it was sent.The printer itself is quite clear.

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,N/A,Vine Customer,4,0,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option."
R3LW0NN16FHC9M,"November 1, 2019",Theresa J.,1,N/A,Unverified,5,0,Scanner functionlity,"Looks good and reads well on Amazon, however this printer is dysfunctional for everyday use. There is no USB port to print to and for scanning you have to open an application even though the printer key pad option actually have a scan prompt cability. When you use that function, it gives you a hard copy of the document. The technical support team lacks the knowledge about the printer functionalities. In fact when they cannot answer a practical question they lie instead. One tech by the name Yury Alexandra Espinosa Piratoba was very dishonest about calling me back.... still waiting. The case number she gave to me does not exit according to another tech support member. The chat request gives an error after submitting"
R369M0HXD51CGA,"July 12, 2019",CorpGovNet,4,N/A,Vine Customer,1,0,"OEM Refills Only, Since New Model: Setup Difficult","This is a great quality printer. Prints quickly with high quality imaging. Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular. I pay around 1/2 a cent for the ink for each page on my black and white Brother... although sometimes it isn't as nice and crispy as it should be."

When i turned it on the screen it asked with or without disc, now i have nothing in my house that takes a disc so i went for using the app. Well the app is useless, the screen gives u a id to type in which doesn't exist in the app so i decided to use the scan the back of the unit option. It scanned, told me it didnt see it. I had to download a different app other then the one that it told me to use.So there is the print app and a mobile assistance app that sees your wifi network. It seemed to work untill i hit print and only heard the rollers spin, then nothing. In order for me to get it to work i had to plug in my either net cable. Also if it wasnt for another reviewer i would have never figured how to get rid of the red blinking light.Now that it's hardwired and my phone and laptop see it the unit works great.

RO5E9LDMF155E,"July 4, 2019",@TrevorHikes,4,N/A,Vine Customer,2,0,"Painful Setup, Great Printing",I've set up a lot of printers over the years and overall wireless printer setup can be tough but this printer's wireless setup process is horrible and in my case - impossible. The app they have you download could never find the printer. Luckily I had a CAT-5 cable already set up so I chose that method and was up and running quickly. I also had trouble loading the paper the first time. Luckily my wife figured it out. So the best advice I have is to make sure there is someone smart nearby. Print quality and speed are fantastic.
R2LSKMKUGRULUU,"July 27, 2019",CNH,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, worth the price.  Monochrome","I originally got this for my kids to use -- school projects are going to bankrupt me -- but I've been so impressed that this has become my main default printer. It will print, copy, scan and fax. Setup was simple for me -- driver update and off we go . . . and I found that it did all the things it was supposed to easily. It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser. The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall). The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning. I miss that more than I thought I would. It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that. I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color. And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain. Two line scrolling menu to control the printer? SHEESH. Horribly cumbersome. BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again. Oh, and the smtp error. That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother. That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit. For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk. But is is worth considering before you commit."
R3DRARC2UN4FLX,"July 13, 2019",Sagewood,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, but prints only in black and white","This printer is really awesome and easy to set-up in few minutes with very little help and guide from the instruction manual. Though I think the set- up was relatively easy for me because I have a lot of experience with printers and electronic gadgets and may not be so easy for a newbie to set-up.I ordered this Laser printer because my old one does not as efficiently I would like (very slow). This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids. Overall this is a great printer for the price point, but I wish it had option for color printing."
R5XZE153QXCEF,"August 2, 2019",Thinker3,3,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,"Great printer, if you can get it to work for you","This printer does all of the jobs it should do quite well. If you can get it to print, it prints well and quickly. If you can get it to scan, it scans well and quickly. And so on. The difficulty is getting the printer to do its jobs. The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text). Since getting the printer, I have been using it by connecting the USB, as getting wireless printing to work every time is a chore.Without the other reviewer's comments, I would never have gotten rid of the error that reminds you to set up SMTP. Actually setting up SMTP has proved beyond my capabilities.The printer also takes a fair bit of time to start up, and it needs to be restarted quite often as its OS locks up if it's left alone.Overall, it's a good printer if you don't mind hooking up the usb every time you want to use it."

I only have myself and two other people and I didn't want to sign a lease for some huge machine. This was a very cost effective compromise. It does everything the big boys do and works just fine for our small office. I suspect if we used a lot more we would need more bells and whistles but it's not necessary right now. The thing we use most is the scan to email and it does it quick and allows us to send off contracts pretty quickly!

Once I unpacked it, I was able to Get it going by connecting it to my wifi at home. It is fast, has great color and it quiet. I haven’t tried to fax anything and I won’t use that feature. But the scanning works great and does the printing. I am very happy!"
