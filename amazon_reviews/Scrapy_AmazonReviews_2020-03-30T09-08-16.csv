R1YMWP1U6TIY1P,"March 27, 2020",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,5,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,Great Printer!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YMWP1U6TIY1P?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,I LOVE this laser printer. I bought this printer to solely make water slide decals for my tumbler business. It works great. The print quality is amazing.
R32N5HZW1PYZHD,"March 27, 2020",Snarky Star,Verified Purchase,1,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,"Love It At First, Now It Is Always 'Device is Unreachable'",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32N5HZW1PYZHD?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Worked great for like a month, now even though it says it is connected, it is only ever 'unreachable'. I've gone in and set up the connection over and over again. It's like any time I want to print ANYTHING I have to reset to factory settings, reconnect, and print immediately. Wait for more than an hour and it's unreachable with no way to connect unless you go back to factory settings and do everything all over again. Garbage."
R32F288TRFH3EM,"March 23, 2020",Brian,Verified Purchase,1,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,Horrible Machine,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32F288TRFH3EM?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,Its probably the worst printer to have shipped in today's shipping environment. Never worked and I would suggest that no one buy this model. Its extremely hard to setup.Brian
R2YGW0VRO3KOSB,"March 21, 2020",george tahan,Verified Purchase,5,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,Great Lexmark printer.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YGW0VRO3KOSB?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Easy setup using ethernet connection, wireless connection on my laptop has a problem and the ethernet connection was a good solution for now. I had an older model Lexmark printer X4550 still working and very quite operation, every low noise.except ink cartridge holder broke."
R21KMQUUGLH80N,"March 21, 2020",Nickie Donlin,Verified Purchase,5,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,Good Printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21KMQUUGLH80N?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"So far, I have no complaints for this printer. I bought it because I don't print all that often and was tired of my cartridges drying up in my inkjet printer. I read some of the reviews about the WiFi issues and took the advice of the ones who made their printer's IP address static. No WiFi issues for me. It prints fast with good quality. Very happy with my purchase."
R2CE2OT3DWUZM6,"March 20, 2020",Chooseup,Verified Purchase,5,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,Perfect Home Office Color Laser Printer!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CE2OT3DWUZM6?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Product received quickly from Amazon. Well packaged. Very easy to set-up and get it on my network. Small footprint and much quieter than my 7 year old HP color laser (and much smaller and lighter). So far, I am very happy with this purchase!"
R3NRYMXAR9G1I9,"March 13, 2020",Rodger M.,Verified Purchase,1,C3224dw,N/A,0,1,No,"BAD PRINTER. ERRORS ALL THE TIME, WE GOT TWO, BOTH HAD THE SAME ISSUE",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NRYMXAR9G1I9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Can't even get to try out a print.. ""REMOVE CARTRIDGE PACKAGING"" Lexmark failed, the doors don't even close properly."
R12R4GJFF35RYO,"March 13, 2020",Raleigh Araga,Verified Purchase,2,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,"Great quality, bad connection problems.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12R4GJFF35RYO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"The printer itself is pretty good. It prints great colored prints, not necessarily top grade for photographers, but sufficient enough for everyday-use colored fliers and portraits. After reading the other reviews, I thought I wouldn't have any issues with connections and that the other buyers complaining of connection issues were isolated incidents; I was wrong. What good is a printer that prints excellent pictures but constantly disconnects from your devices when you need it?! It was constantly offline. I decided to return and go with a more reliable Canon."
