I am so disappointed. Beyond that, I would also add that after yet another 2 hour telephone call to Lexmark yesterday, I have yet to receive the promised return communication from a more advanced tech. Lexmark? Really?

We are incredibly pleased with it. Since it arrived and we set it up--which was simple for my husband but he is an IT guy so consider that--we've used it a ton. Probably a good two reams of paper and we've been satisfied with it all.It is an incredibly quick printer and scanner. The print quality is great and the ink never bleeds. I've enjoyed using this printer with my crafts, specifically my waterslide decals, because the laser ink doesn't need to be sealed and doesn't bleed under moisture. It dries quickly and applies precisely.Scanning setup took a bit more effort for me (husband wasn't home) but I got it up and running just fine by myself. The menu is color and so far has worked well, I have no problem operating this printer at all. My multiple devices have paired with it great.As far as laser printers go, and this one also being a color printer, this is an excellent choice for a home or small business printer! I would absolutely recommend it without reservations at this point. Of course, if anything changes I'll update this review accordingly."

Also, there are some open source software scanners that will also allow you to scan on your local PC. I am using NAPS2 and it works great with this."

What good is a printer that prints excellent pictures but constantly disconnects from your devices when you need it?! It was constantly offline.

I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this. Not enough to send back because the printer is so quick and sharp, but a bit annoyed my colors on the screen won't come out on the page exactly. I hope this review helps someone."

There is no USB port to print to and for scanning you have to open an application even though the printer key pad option actually have a scan prompt cability. When you use that function, it gives you a hard copy of the document. The technical support team lacks the knowledge about the printer functionalities. In fact when they cannot answer a practical question they lie instead. One tech by the name Yury Alexandra Espinosa Piratoba was very dishonest about calling me back.... still waiting. The case number she gave to me does not exit according to another tech support member. The chat request gives an error after submitting"

I ended up having to run a 20 foot USB cable to it and it still never worked. Just printed page after page of random letters, numbers, and symbols. No response on the front panel, cant even turn it off without unplugging it. Downloaded all drivers for it and no difference. Waited over an hour on the phone for technical support on multiple occasions before giving up. Lexmark chat tech support doesn't even load when you try and use it. It just says there is an error with the application. I have about 6 hours into this thing and its never worked. Don't waste your time."

That said, the past two inkjet printers we've had in our house have started out great and ended horribly, with connectivity issues and smeared pages.So far this is love-at-first-print. Out of the box, this was easy to set up and pretty quick. I did install an app on my phone which made getting it going pretty easy.So far, I'm able to print and the prints are great - both black and white and color turn out great. It is a tad louder than our inkjet, but the print quality is so clear! And no smearing.Another plus is the paper capacity. Our old printer had to be reloaded often, with a paper tray that holds 250My biggest concern is the cost of replacement toner, but honestly, it might be cheaper in the long run. To keep my last printer going (kind of - with murky prints) I had to replace a maintenance box twice, so the costs were adding up.At the time of writing this, it looks like there is a black toner cartridge return program that costs $85 for the black toner, making the black replacement a little less than 1/2 the cost of the printer itself - so it might just be cheaper to purchase an all-new printer when this one runs out of toner, or at least two colors."
