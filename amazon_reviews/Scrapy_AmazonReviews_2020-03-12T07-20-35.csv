RY11929L02OAT,"October 3, 2019",Orestes,Verified Purchase,1,MC3224adwe,N/A,15,2,Yes,Defective out of the box - poor warranty support,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY11929L02OAT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,"We are very sorry for your recent experience and, in this case, applaud you for your patience and commitment in trying to fix your Lexmark purchase.  We have a highly skilled and experienced technical support center and strive for all of our customers to have an excellent experience at all times. Lexmark tracks the performance of our help desk and maintains a high level of responsiveness.  However, in this instance, we clearly failed.  I can only hope we can correct this situation for you in the future.  We appreciate your input and will look to this to help drive incremental improvements in our processes, response and timing in order to help you and any future customers resolve issues quickly and as painlessly as possible. ","This particular printer was defective when delivered. As soon as it was set up it was obvious that the print quality was very poor. After contacting Lexmark and sending examples and details (SN, proof of purchase etc) of the printer, the initial diagnosis was a faulty toner cartridge. A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience. Its possible that if you happen to get a working printer, it might serve you well. But don't count on much in the way of support from Lexmark if you happen to get a dud."
R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,Vine Customer,4,MC3224adwe,N/A,31,0,No,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended."

RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,3,MB2236adw,N/A,57,6,Yes,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGZ49J58DX0W5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,"Hello - We wanted to respond and thank you for your recent comments on the Lexmark MB2236adw. This feedback was very valuable and we wanted to let you know what steps we have taken to correct these issues.We have addressed the flickering light situation that you mentioned and have a new firmware release available on Lexmark.com that addresses it. You can go here to download it: support.lexmark.com/firmwareAlso, based on your feedback, we have taken action to improve the SMTP set-up situation as well. A new firmware release is in process and will be available soon. In the interim, we are going to have new devices default to the setting being OFF vs. ON as products leave the factory. We believe that most users will not need to set up SMTP on their devices, but if someone does, they can turn that setting on from the menu or via our web tool.Again, thank you for your insight. We value it and appreciate it and welcome your comments or questions.Best Regards,Lexmark"," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."
R218MLO8BAOX78,"November 8, 2019",MH,Verified Purchase,1,MC3224adwe,N/A,5,0,No,THIS PRINTER IS NOT USER FRIENDLY.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R218MLO8BAOX78?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"The only things positive about a Lexmark MC3224adwe printer was its print quality and its physical construction (51 lbs). The printer was delivered without written support to setup this printer. Lexmark's online information is essentially meaningless. It was not only hard to understand, but it was vastly incomplete and misleading. After spending over 10 hours on the telephone with Lexmark's 3rd party contractor/support team, the technician got the printer to print properly. The technician could not get the scanner to function with the Lexmark information supplied to the 3rd party support team. The scanner worked after being ""jerry rigged"" by the technician with a non Lexmark product. Whoever designed Lexmark's software did not seem know what they were doing. The printer is built like a tank with the brain of a worm. I finally gave up and returned the printer to Amazon."
R3PX6BZ14XLM2W,"November 19, 2019",Many Words,Verified Purchase,5,C3326dw,N/A,4,0,No,A little bit longer than advertised - but excellent machine,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PX6BZ14XLM2W?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,,"Just got the printer on line - which was simple enough although the documentation is Windows oriented - Mac set up was just follow the menu items on the printer screen and when complete - it just worked. Love the color, clarity, and ease of changing the cartridges. This is the best design... just pull open a drawer from the front, and they are laying in there in order. Lift and replace. No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem. The printer has a noise level when printing (and did quiet when not) however, its not much different from the Brother laser printer it replaced and is less noisy than an ink jet. For its price point and functionality - it is no problem."

I was concerned about switching from an inkjet to a laser and I'm so happy I did. The print quality is amazing. Everything is so crisp and clear compared to my inkjet. The only thing I wish I could do is print pictures. I mean I can print them on 8x10 but cannot print anything smaller. This printer is also really heavy which is good and bad. Makes it very difficult to move but also means its heavy duty well made. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good laser.
R31IRF6KKMLQOE,"October 7, 2019",Casysdavid,Verified Purchase,2,MC3224dwe,N/A,19,1,Yes,Revised after some miserable days of ownership - down from 4 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31IRF6KKMLQOE?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,"We are very sorry for your experience in trying to setup the Lexmark MC3224adwe. For any issues, please contact Lexmark's official Technical Support group at 1-800-LEXMARK and our team will be happy to assist you.","Update: This printer is a PITA! Freezes and won't respond to anything without power cycling. Paper jam error messages constantly - ""COMPLETELY REMOVE PAPER TRAY, CLEAR THE JAM..."" --- there is no paper jam. This happens following a power-up and nearly every time I use the paper bypass. I'm regretting the purchase. Otherwise, print quality is good and it's very fast. I do like the smallish footprint, but no doc feeder, no fax and too many interruptions to reset and clear imaginary jams...Original review:First off, I'm an engineer at an automation company and totally speak the language. Nonetheless, I nearly sent this printer back after starting to read faq and hunting through the HORRIBLE Lexmark site. I just didn't want to deal with a bunch of stress simply to setup a desktop printer. That said, it took me all of 5-minutes (Windows 10) to get things up and running: remove tape and tabs that are clearly indicated, load paper, power up and follow instructions on the touchscreen. I did not install the included CD software; I did not do any firmware update - it's working fine, so unless I find something, it'll likely stay this way. Every computer in our office group connected easily (Add Printer, found the Lex immediately, select ...done).This model (MC3224dwe) does NOT have fax; I assumed this was an ""all-in-one"" device which is how I started my search criteria: ""all in one color laser printer"". My fault for not reading specs carefully - Amazon search fails like this often and I know better. I purchased because of good reviews and price - so far, so good."

RCWVYCEA8V2JZ,"November 9, 2019",Vizoere,Verified Purchase,4,MC3224adwe,N/A,1,0,No,"Good value, weak wifi, a bit complicated",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCWVYCEA8V2JZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"I finally got it set up and working properly. I'm able to print from my two Windows-based computers and from my android phone. Document quality is superb, but photo quality is mediocre. I expected that when buying a laser, so no points off.I had several problems setting it up, most of which I think are due to a weak wifi radio. The printer is on the opposite end of the house from my router with walls, cabinets, a refrigerator between them. That said, other devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc) work ok in this office.When turning on the printer for the first time, the screen showed a message telling me to go to a specific URL and download the Lexmark software for my mobile device to help set up the printer. I just went to the Google Play store and searched for Lexmark Mobile Assistant, and it came right up. Installed that and started the configuration. It seemed a bit complicated, but ended up working fine to configure the printer.Within the app, it suggested downloading the Lexmark printing app and the Lexmark print plugin. I did both and tried to print a picture from my phone. That's where the problems started. It would fail to connect, then connect ok long enough to send a print, then it couldn't connect anymore.I switched to setting up the Windows computers, downloaded the software from Lexmark (skipped using the CD, as they're usually out-of-date), and started the install. It couldn't locate the printer on the network, and after several tries using a couple of the options, I just clicked the Advanced button, typed in the IP address manually, and the install finished. Once that was finished, Windows could print and the printer spit out the paper with what I expected, but every time, I saw a message pop up that it couldn't connect to the printer.Eventually, after troubleshooting and searching Google, I decided to try plugging it in through an ethernet cable instead of worrying with wifi. After changing the Windows printer port to reflect the new IP address, I stopped getting the can't connect error. After deleting and re-adding the printer on my phone, it can now print as well.Overall, I'm happy with the printer, as it has the features I need for a reasonable price. As an IT person, I was able to work through the difficulties caused by the weak wifi radio, but I don't know that someone not familiar with networking would have been able to without assistance."

I finally decided to go with this one because it seems all printers get bad reviews but this one didn't seem to be too bad. I received my first one very quickly and I was very excited. I opened it and saw that the scanning bed was cracked. So, back in the box it went. Mind you, this is a heavy machine and it's not easy to pack it up, etc. I requested a new one to be sent to me.The second machine took longer to get to me but I got it in about 3 days. I got it out of the box and got it set up. I connected it to my internet and thought things would be realitively each. No such luck. You have to down load an app to your phone to be able to print from your phone. I do a LOT of printing from my phone or Ipad. So, I down load the app and it can't find the printer even though they are on the same network. After getting the manual off of HP website and doing some searching, I realize it's because one of the settings is wrong. Sorry - I can't remember the setting now and I don't have the printer any longer. So, I set the indicator and it seems my phone sees the printer. Yea! So, I go to send a document to the printer. It's about a 10 page document. My current deskjet would hardly take any time to print this type of document. I waited and waited, etc.... The printer kept saying it was receiving the document but wasn't printing. After about 30 minutes, I decided to try to set up the software on my printer. Of course, in the middle of setting up the software, the printer decided to 'start' printing my document but only printed about a quarter of one page and that is all I ever saw it print.So, I decided to try to concentrate on getting my computer set up. Again, my deskjet was never an issue. Find the printer and start printing. I updated the software and tried to print a document again from my computer. I kept getting communication errors between my computer and the printer. The printer was online the whole time and so was my computer. Mind you this went on for a few hours one night and into the next day.When I finally think something is printing, it printed a small box and then I got a firmware error. So, I went to look for an update. Again, you have to connect thru your computer to the printer using the computer number. The printer was showing me the number but everytime I tried to access it, it would time out. I tried this for a few hours. This is the only way I could find in the manual to actually update the firmware on the printer, but since I could not get to the actual menu, I couldn't update it.By this time, I'm fed up. So, I decided in the end to just return the second machine also. Please keep in mind, that I work in IT. I'm not a hardware person, but I can figure out most things if I have instructions. I don't know how they expect anyone to get this working without support. Yes, I could have called for help and it might have been resolved, but I don't like to have to call for help. It should have been working or easily fixed when I connected."

Unpacking and setting up was easy… And using the free Lexmark iOS app to set up my Wi-Fi connection couldn’t have been simpler. My Mac Pro saw the printer instantly and I was up and running in two minutes.And while there is no Lexmark software to run this printer… I already owned VueScan, A third-party scanning software… And it runs this printer perfectly, including all of the options for resolution, flatbed scanning, document feeder scanning, and everything else. You can also access all of the printers options through your web browser by locating the printers address on your home network.So… Absolutely a joy to set up and use with my Mac Pro running Mojave."

For this unit I’m going Wi-Fi.Power on asks if you want to set up via a mobile device, which directs you to the Lexmark Mobile Assistant app on your phone (I had to go install it). Using that app, you set up via Wi-Fi direct by finding the printer in your Wi-Fi connections and connecting (temporarily) to it.It will then search for wireless networks. It quickly found my 2.4 GHz network (not my 5 GHz). Typed in my password and we were done.If you can get the app to work, trust me, you’ll be happy. The manual ‘set it up from the console’ only has left and right arrows with an OK button to advance the letter system. So typing in any kind of lengthy or difficult password will take a hot minute!Clicking the power button puts it in a kind of sleep mode and to power it off completely hold the power button down for about 5 seconds.Once the printer was fully configured, I did a power on time test. From completely turned off, a click of the power button to ‘status ready’ took 53 seconds in Wi-Fi mode. I tested when configured via network cable and exactly the same time.Next up: the PC install. I tried to find ‘just the driver’ on the cd but the Lexmark installer is pretty much going to have to run on your local system (the web site had a more current version to download). I was thankful that at the end of the install process was a separate ‘utility’ installer for a system tray application to keep you aware of print job status, ink levels and other standard tray alerts. Thank you for not forcing it on us! But, it’s there if you like that sort of thing.The first thing I printed? My notes for this review! It was fast, I didn’t time it and only a few lines.The second thing was the image of the printer on the product page. I started the stop watch once I saw the communication light stop blinking, which is when you hear the printer spin up. Semi color page took 8 seconds.Two page document with both sides printing, 15 seconds. Same doc two pages: 10 seconds. 20 page single document B&W and Color both clocked in around 50 seconds. The attached vid shows the pace of a print jobs and the method of double-sided printing.Next I printed a color seating chart of Sun Trust field. Clicking print to finish was 15 seconds. 5 seconds communications and just under 10 seconds later it was in the tray.The printer comes with toner of course and the cartridges are going to yield approximately 500 pages for each of the Color cartridges and up to 750 pages for the Black print cartridge. Each cartridge has a model number for the ‘return’ version service and new version model numbers of standard yield and high yield. As of this posting, prices are not available on the site.Overall this was an easy to set up laser printer that is perfect for a small business or home office, could service a larger set of users easily and prints a quality sheet relatively fast. It’s got beefy stats and does what they said it would do."

One was a toner printer and the other an inkjet. In comparison, this laser printer is much faster and prints a higher quality image. Also, the color quality is far more consistent than with my ink jet. Its size is similar to the other two but this is far heavier. My postal service carrier had to get my husband to carry it for her. It is also much noiser than the other two, by a lot! Setup took me about 30 minutes. It was not plug-n-play by any means. I am not computer savvy so this may be easier for other people. My network found the printer immediately however, it said the driver was not working. My computer showed the correct driver was installed but would not connect the two. I tried downloading the driver from Lexmark's website but could not find one comparable with windows 10. Eventually, I used the set up disk included with the printer and it worked. Inconvinent if, like me, your computer does not have a disc drive.For my phone, I had to download the lexmark app for it connect to the printer. I'm not sure if there is a way to use it from my android without the app; this was simply the easiest way I could find to get it up and running. It does require the print jobs to pass over other networks on the way to the printer. Not the most effective or secure way to print.Update: the printer is constantly coming offline. I called customer support about the issue. Explaining that I was trying to print from my smartphone, customer support said they needed access to my laptop to diagnose the problem. After screen sharing, he opened the admin log reports for my entire computer and said the issue was with the error reports I had not addressed. Mind you, these reports were for my computer, not the printer and included things like a crash report for my office software. Customer support then said the only way to fix the printer was for me to pay one of their techs to fix the log report on my computer. What?! What is customer support for if they don't trouble shoot AND help fix the issue? The gentleman was rude in his reply and told me if I didn't want to pay that was my decision. Then he hung up. Umm okay. I have put my old reliable printer back up. At least the customer service with my other printer brand is helpful and the machine works, even if it is ancient."
RJI0VX8V39ZGZ,"July 31, 2019",Summit,Vine Customer,1,C3326dw,N/A,9,1,Yes,Built like a tank & fast,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJI0VX8V39ZGZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,Thanks for taking the time to review your Lexmark C3326dw Color Laser Printer.

Just contact Lexmark Technical Support at 1-800-LEXMARK and ask the agent to reference SR 1-310 946 754 872. We look forward to hearing from you.,"I'm no stranger to laser printers- I worked my way through the I.T. industry, starting as the 'computer guy' who would come to your office to make your computers function- often elbows deep in a laser printer. Lexmark was originally a part of IBM and was separated in 1991 to be its own thing, but IBM is the go-to company for business class machines- it's even part of their name. The Lexmark printers are well known to business computing people, but probably less known to people who don't work in the computer biz and home users. Their products tend to be built to take a beating and this printer is no exception.One thing that stood out was the steel frame. It's a heavy, industrial quality machine. There isn't any ""fluff"" on it like many printers have- like touch screens and stylistic design. It's simple. The toner tray is unique and the paper tray is more simple than many- but that simplicity makes it durable. The tray latches in with a confident feel. By comparison, my HP color laser has a loose fitting, sloppy paper tray.I don't want more apps on my phone, so I configured this using the super simple little screen and buttons. The longest part was entering the password for the 2.4G network (it isn't compatible with the 5G network, boo...) but despite the simple buttons, it didn't take long as it quickly scrolls through letters and numbers. It connected instantly. I installed the whole software and driver package from the web site and noticed there is a new firmware upgrade as of a couple weeks ago- so I will apply that soon. The web site linked to the icon Lexmark places in their Windows software doesn't work. In fact, I can only bring up the printer settings when printing something- the printer control panel doesn't work any other way. One can also directly connect to the printer's web interface by simply putting the printer IP in a browser window. This is also how one updates the firmware once downloaded.Now, here's where things went a little strange. The printing I get is VERY fast and black and white prints are crisp. It defaults to printing both sides, which is annoying so I have to change settings. Color prints on mine are terrible, but since nobody else is reporting this problem I'm guessing it's because the delivery person tossed this in my driveway. I heard it hit the ground from inside the house. Packaging was minimal- the inside box has the molded foam around the printer but there was no padding between that box and the shipping box. I'll be looking into the problem more after the firmware update but the blue cartridge may be the issue. Printing various solid colors, the blue is extremely blotchy although no sign of toner leakage or damage to the cartridge. Until that is resolved, the color printing on this is extremely poor. Despite the color issue, the grainy appearance when printing a photo quality source is not nearly as good as my 6 year old HP color laser. For now, I'm only taking a star off for the wonky interface and the lousy software. Lexmark has always had wonky interfaces, but they make awesome business class printers. The printing issue on mine appears to be an anomaly and I'll update as I look to resolve it.*** update. all printing is blotchy to the point I can't even use the prints for draft working copies. I've gone through everything possible to attempt to resolve it to no avail. Not looking forward to having to deal with warranty and tech support- but I'll go through all that when I can find extra time to kill.****Second update. After trying a few basic things to try to reset the printer, it has failed to the point where it is now just a waste of space in my house. Warranty? Good luck with that. It was probably damaged when the USPS delivery involved throwing it in my driveway. Dropping off at the recycling depot today where I'll have to PAY to get rid of it."

Well a week after the call the support rep keeps telling me that the tracking numbers will be available in 2 days. This has been going on for about a week now and no tracking numbers. I am ready to return this unit to amazon and be done with this brand.

They are nearly reliable (except when they break, run out of ink, mysteriously stop responding to commands like ""PRINT""...etc.) and slow and steady. Did I mention slow?So I was pretty thrilled to installer this Lexmark Color Laser Printer. A million years ago, when laser printers first came out (and my pet dinosaur roamed the earth), I remember how clean and crisp the printing appeared on the page . Only large institutions could afford laser printers way back then. Now ordinary mortals can.Now: the printer was easy to install. There's a cool little pamphlet with pictures detailing the instructions--no words! If you can follow the pictures, you're all set. The pictures even tell you what's recyclable. Awesome. However, there's a bar-code scanner for your phone to register the printer--decided to register the printer by phone on the spur of the moment. And some of the choices were a bit fuzzy; it asked for country and there was no place to CHOOSE my country. Things like that. More about the phone app in a second.Once the printer was installed, the Lexmark was MAGICAL. It printed in seconds flat. It took three seconds to print a full color print--crisp, beautiful. The printing for a full page was clean, no bleeding from the edges, and all the words were black and fine. The speed was astounding.However, the android app was really needs improvement. Some people do tons of printing from their phones nowadays, and if you do, you may have a problem with this app. First of all, the photos didn't print in color from my phone. They all printed in black-and-white. Lovely black-and-white, but they ARE color photos. Also, I can't print document from phone (only photo, camera, web page or clipboard). It would be great to be able to print a PDF or Word doc., for example, but it does not seem possible from the phone app. Granted, I did not try to troubleshoot at all. But I would really prefer that these kinks had been worked out before putting the app out to the public, because I'd like to have these capabilities at my fingertips immediately.The printer itself is terrific. I love it--it's fast and the printing is gorgeous. However, the app needs some work."

R2YTNWDLW9T3UB,"July 25, 2019",THATCHMAN1,Vine Customer,5,C3326dw,N/A,1,0,No,Made replacing my HP laser very easy,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YTNWDLW9T3UB?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,,"I've been a user of entry level HP laserjet printers for years, and my current one is finally becoming problematic. This replacement printer is FASTER, SMALLER, and QUIETER than what it's replacing-- which was an HP CP2025.It was very well boxed for shipping, unpacked easily, was not damaged in shipping and nothing had moved around.Unpacking is easy. It slid out easily and the protective materials over the toners was easier to remove than most printers. The tape was minimal and I was on my way in no time.Setup was a breeze. It asks several questions when you turn it on to set date, time, location and to clarify whether you want to set it up with a mobile phone app or not. Easy.Windows recognized it easily as did my iPhone (AirPrint compatible!) and I didn't need to break into the book included, nor the CD that came with the driver. It couldn't have been more painless to unbox and install.Using it is also a breeze. It's much quieter than my former HP when idling, goes to sleep and wakes up faster and does the job without any paper jamming nor complaints.The only part that has taken a tiny bit of getting used to has been the single paper tray. part used for things like labels or envelopes. It works very well. It prints on thicker media very fast compared to my HP, but I do miss a bit of a wing to prop up heavier, floppier or thicker singles of paper. They never fall out and the printer seems to grip on them right way, so there is no deficiency here, just difference.The thing is super attractive to look at, does everything I need it to with expediency, and while it's a full 10 years more youthful than my HP, it seems to be better built.The place where I work uses Lexmark for their most challenging, difficult environments and for the most complex print jobs like GLM printing, and they hold up. I'm really happy with this printer and I trust it will do very well for me for a long time."
R2TFKG1COZQ94X,"July 28, 2019",Daniel Bobinski,Vine Customer,5,C3326dw,N/A,1,0,No,"Solid build, quick & easy install, fast, clean printing.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TFKG1COZQ94X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,,"This is an awesome printer. Super easy to set up -- it was operating in under five minutes! Fast, clean printing, too. I also installed the software on my laptop, allowing me to print wirelessly from anywhere in the house. Then I installed the printer app on my mobile phone (that took a few minutes to figure out, but once it configured it works great).I'm very pleased with how fast the printer starts printing once I send a document -- it's literally just a few seconds. And again, the printing is clean and clear, both B&W and color. Printer tray holds 250 sheets, which is average for most of today's printers. I'd love if it would hold an entire ream, but if that's my only complaint, I have no real complaint.I used an Okidata C5200 laser printer for more than a decade and it performed GREAT. So after it finally gave up the ghost I bought another Oki, but I was very disappointed. I've since tried Brother and HP, but for color printing, this Lexmark seems to have all its ducks in a row. It performs soundly and does NOT sound or feel cheap. I'm pleased as punch and because of its solid build, my impression is that it's going to last a long time. I'm giving it five solid stars."

Lexmark is pleased to provide multiple after market toner offers: A High Yield that has a low operating cost but a higher ticket price OR a lower yield that offers a slightly higher operational cost but is more sensitive to cash flow.  A full list of our supply offerings can be found at Lexmark.com by navigating to the correct product page by entering the model name in the search bar. ,"I have always been fond of Lexmark printers and was excited to have one to replace my quickly dying other brand printer. Over the last few years printer have gone down in price and up in quality. This is a laser printer. The tray will up to to 250 pages, plus there is a single sheet feeder. The printer is wireless. It can print up to 26 pages per minute.Setup is fast and easy. Lexmark has a toner cartridge recycling. My major criticism is the cost of the replacement cartridges."

Print quality ok.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ABNJ3ZVRD44G?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,,"This printer is much heavier than I was expecting. I’m not sure where all the weight is, as the machine itself is very simple, with no extra bells or whistles. No copying, no scanning, just printing.Setup was very painless. The instructions are very minimal (all pictures): basically, remove the packing tape and safety covers on the toner, install the software, print. I used the cd to install drivers and software and everything went smoothly and quickly.Printing was fast and just a bit noisy. The fan is loud, but it wasn’t an issue for me. Noise could be an issue if you were printing hundreds of pages at a time.Print quality was a little less than I expected. I don’t print much color, but I have some business documents that need occasional color, and I have to say that this printer didn’t wow me. It’s ok...but, if I was seriously looking to impress, I might look for something a bit sharper and cleaner.Overall, it’s a no-nonsense machine that does a quick and fairly nice job of my color printing needs."

That said, the past two inkjet printers we've had in our house have started out great and ended horribly, with connectivity issues and smeared pages.So far this is love-at-first-print. Out of the box, this was easy to set up and pretty quick. I did install an app on my phone which made getting it going pretty easy.So far, I'm able to print and the prints are great - both black and white and color turn out great. It is a tad louder than our inkjet, but the print quality is so clear! And no smearing.Another plus is the paper capacity. Our old printer had to be reloaded often, with a paper tray that holds 250My biggest concern is the cost of replacement toner, but honestly, it might be cheaper in the long run. To keep my last printer going (kind of - with murky prints) I had to replace a maintenance box twice, so the costs were adding up.At the time of writing this, it looks like there is a black toner cartridge return program that costs $85 for the black toner, making the black replacement a little less than 1/2 the cost of the printer itself - so it might just be cheaper to purchase an all-new printer when this one runs out of toner, or at least two colors."

I started with wired network but settled with WiFi network connectivity which was also easy to setup.The printing speed is really good but the printer is very noisy.I also found that the print quality is not as crips are my black and white laser printer for simple documents.

Both ethernet and wireless compatible, the technology allows you to set up the device according to your needs, even if you choose to print from your cellphone. You can scan, fax, and print. The color copies it makes are crisp and clear. At around 40 pounds, the printer can be moved if needed. It measures 13 inches high, 15 ½ inches wide, and 14 ½ inches deep, which makes it almost a square shape and capable of fitting in smaller spaces.A small control screen that is touch-enabled is located on the left front of the unit. The keypad that comes up is very touch-sensitive. I had to enter my long wireless information more than once in setting the printer up. The only negative I have encountered in using the printer is in the set-up. Instructions are clear and detailed for removing the clear tapes and plastic tabs, keeping the toner ink in place. You may need to chat online with a company representative as I did to ensure you have established connectivity to all your devices.You do have to download the printer driver which comes on a provided disc or from the given website. You will also need to enter your unique wireless information on your printer keypad if you are choosing this method. All in all, this was not a bad experience; the representative was very helpful and clear; however, the set-up process is not entirely intuitive.The printer functions beautifully. We have it connected to two laptops. I love its quiet operation and fast 24 pages per minutes printing speed."
RGN6CJJRKWO81,"August 6, 2019",Matthew R,Vine Customer,5,MC3224adwe,N/A,3,0,No,Color printer/photocopier.  600dpi with photo enhancement.  Wireless capable and fast.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGN6CJJRKWO81?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"This is a nice compact color printer. It also allows you to scan, fax and copy. The printer can copy/scan/print in 600dpi but if you use the photo settings you can get results that look better than 600dpi. It will not produce the results you would expect from a photo printer but it can produce nice quality output if you use the right settings.The touch screen is also in color and is bright and clear. (you can see it at an angle easily as well) It is nice to scroll through the menus like you would on your smartphone. (touch and drag)The scanner seems to make images a little brighter and a more 'washed out' than the original in some cases. The software comes with a TWAIN-compliant driver that will let you import images into your favorite graphics manipulation program. (like Photoshop for example) I was able to scan photos with close to photo-quality output by selecting the Photo Mode from the menu of the TWIAN driver and changing the dpi setting to 600. The image looked better than 600dpi but it did scan in 600dpi. The full 8.5x11 sheet was 5100 x 6600 pixels. (if you divide the pixels by 600 it ends up being 8.5 x 11)For office or home use, it is a great little printer as long as you aren't expecting it to print photo quality. One nice thing about a laser printer is that it can sit of years without issues, unlike an inkjet where the ink can dry and cause issues if it is not used frequently.The printer was easy to install and comes with an actual CD/DVD. (you can find the driver on Epson's website very easily if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer) It can also be set up to print from a phone over WiFi. My experience with printing from a phone is that it is a last resort since the phone itself limits the control you have over the print output.In summary, the printer only prints in 600dpi but some kind of enhancement is going on that makes photos look better than 600dpi when it is used. Even with those settings, it does not with photo quality results. For graphics, text and even photo-like quality, it is a great all-around multifunction.The printer goes to sleep on its own after a bit so to use it wirelessly you may need to power it on. It can be used as a scanner though it can only scan at 600dpi. (photo mode enhances the image for photos) I haven't tried the fax functionality since I do not fax much. The copier functionality is slick. You can navigate through the menus to get the optimal settings.It does everything I would expect it to do. The photo enhancements from photo mode produced very nice results for 600dpi, even though the output is not photo quality. I printed a picture of my friend's Camaro on regular copy paper for reference."
