R2HAJS2HEJAAJ4,"April 24, 2020",Amazon Customer,5,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Great printer.  Easy to connect to WiFi network.,"I have to say that I've had a lot of printers in my life, but this one seems to be the easiest I've had to get connected to WiFi. And I can print from my iPhone! Any computer just connects and prints, without even any setup on the devices/laptops. Impressive. Perfect size - not too big. All the features. Good price. No complaints.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HAJS2HEJAAJ4?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,
R6E11ZPS7PDD2,"April 24, 2020",I bought this,5,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,I'm glad I bought this before the seller jacked up the prices,"I bought this at a much lower price before the epidemic started. It's a good printer, easy to setup and I can print from multiple devices in my house.My Main issue is how the seller has Jacked up the prices to almost twice the amount suddenly after the epidemic started.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6E11ZPS7PDD2?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R312W6349D4H2X,"April 18, 2020",Danila,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,No,"when I needed to buy a toner I found that there is no genuine toner, that is, it is a disposable product, for the cost of toner it is feasible to buy a new printer that accepts genuine toners",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R312W6349D4H2X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,
R1H9XVGAWC6CWF,"April 18, 2020",Robin Nicole,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,"Expensive toner, prints when it wants, not worth the money!","This printer was great in the beginning. Then the minute I needed toner, errors began. With everything! I spent over $300 on four toner cartridges directly from Lexmark’s recycle program: where you use it once and send it back. That was the cheapest I could find for legit toner. That was more than the printer cost in the beginning! Then the errors began. Toner not recognized. Fisher needed attention. Toner waste bottle needed changing although it’s supposed to hold way more than what it’s has in it. One minute it prints. One minute it doesn’t. Since getting it to work with the LEXMARK toner, occasionally it looks faded, with brand new toner! I’ve had other brands of laser printers before and they worked so much better and toner didn’t cost as much as a car payment. When this ones fully dead, I will NEVER buy another Lexmark product again!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H9XVGAWC6CWF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R1SWL6XZQ4JW7L,"April 13, 2020",Chad Guynn,5,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Great little printer for the money,"After reading some of the reviews I was very wary about buying this printer. I needed a color laser and I spent around $400 dollars on my last color laser and it only lasted two years. At around $141 plus tax, I went ahead and took a shot on this printer. So far I have been very pleased. It prints photos as well as my old expensive printer and the text looks very nice. I guess i will see later how long the toner lasts. But at this price point, the print seems well worth it!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SWL6XZQ4JW7L?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,
R14YDU1EKR9CA5,"April 12, 2020",momma1,1,C3224dw,Unverified,Warning! Replacement toner cartridges are insanely expensive!,"I ALMOST made the mistake of buying this, but luckily I searched for the replacement cartridges and discovered they are $335 for the 4 cartridges! That is a TOTALLY INSANE price, this very day on Amazon you can get a Canon Color Image CLASS LBP622Cdw (Wireless, Mobile Ready, Duplex Laser Printer, Compact Size) for $206, and a full set of High Yield replacement toner cartridges with and extra HY black is &79.99!And I have searched hi and lo here at Amazon, and have not found a generic or aftermarket for this lexmark printer!I'm ordering the Canon!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14YDU1EKR9CA5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,
