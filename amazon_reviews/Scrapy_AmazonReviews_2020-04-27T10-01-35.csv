No complaints."

Then the minute I needed toner, errors began. With everything! I spent over $300 on four toner cartridges directly from Lexmark’s recycle program: where you use it once and send it back. That was the cheapest I could find for legit toner. That was more than the printer cost in the beginning! Then the errors began. Toner not recognized. Fisher needed attention. Toner waste bottle needed changing although it’s supposed to hold way more than what it’s has in it. One minute it prints. One minute it doesn’t. Since getting it to work with the LEXMARK toner, occasionally it looks faded, with brand new toner! I’ve had other brands of laser printers before and they worked so much better and toner didn’t cost as much as a car payment. When this ones fully dead, I will NEVER buy another Lexmark product again!"

I needed a color laser and I spent around $400 dollars on my last color laser and it only lasted two years. At around $141 plus tax, I went ahead and took a shot on this printer. So far I have been very pleased. It prints photos as well as my old expensive printer and the text looks very nice. I guess i will see later how long the toner lasts. But at this price point, the print seems well worth it!"

Support hasn't been helpful.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O8X35XHSOT92?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,,"This seemed like a pretty good printer. It was fast and reliable and while it was very loud when printing, it was silent at all other times. After 5 months of light usage it started printing repeated fat lines of black, magenta, blue, and yellow on every page. It looks more like printing than toner smearing. I tried to contact customer support but there are a lot of roadblocks to getting to an actual person and I don't have time to step through all the hoops so I'm writing it off and buying another brand."

I have an older but updated iMac and for some reason I can’t print or scan through WiFi. The printer connects to the WiFi and even shows up on the computer but the computer is unable to add the printer. This made the set up very frustrating and time extensive. If the printer is connected to the computer with the USB there are no issues. This is the way I left it. It was also a bit of a confusing set up to connect to the google cloud print but it works now. Scan and print have good quality. The document feeder is a very helpful addition. I love that the printer can print on two sides. I have had this printer for over a week and have used it daily and for many different things during our remote learning and quarantine.

This is because Lexmark is back to its old business model of selling cheap printers and making a killing on the consumables. I'd avoid this and buy the https://www.amazon.com/Xerox-WorkCentre-6515-DN-Multifunction/dp/B01M6DJQEQ - it costs $50 more but toner is only $20 (less than a third of the price)."

The airprint still doesn't work...at all...and the scanning feature is not working either. I would advise anyone considering purchasing this Lexmark to save your money and look elsewhere. I am so disappointed. Beyond that, I would also add that after yet another 2 hour telephone call to Lexmark yesterday, I have yet to receive the promised return communication from a more advanced tech. Lexmark? Really? You can do better. If there were lemon laws for printers, this one would definitely qualify as a lemon."

Anything other than photos are printed on this printer. Not that it does not print a decent photo but I have a much more expensive professional printer just for photos.

We are incredibly pleased with it. Since it arrived and we set it up--which was simple for my husband but he is an IT guy so consider that--we've used it a ton. Probably a good two reams of paper and we've been satisfied with it all.It is an incredibly quick printer and scanner. The print quality is great and the ink never bleeds. I've enjoyed using this printer with my crafts, specifically my waterslide decals, because the laser ink doesn't need to be sealed and doesn't bleed under moisture. It dries quickly and applies precisely.Scanning setup took a bit more effort for me (husband wasn't home) but I got it up and running just fine by myself. The menu is color and so far has worked well, I have no problem operating this printer at all. My multiple devices have paired with it great.As far as laser printers go, and this one also being a color printer, this is an excellent choice for a home or small business printer! I would absolutely recommend it without reservations at this point. Of course, if anything changes I'll update this review accordingly."

If you're tired of these same things, buy this printer! It's fantastic and for the price ($70 on sale) I don't know any that are better.

But it is awesome so far!I'm replacing a 20-year-old high-end Brother printer, so I'll compare it to that. The Brother cost $600 20 years ago, so I was not expecting much at all from a $117 printer.Most of the negative reviews mentioned trouble connecting via WiFi. My first thought was I didn't care about that. I've never had a WiFi printer in the past and didn't see any reason it would be necessary now. However, I have gotten married since 20 years ago and we have kids and more computers in the house, so I figured if it worked that would be great and if not, well, it was only $117 and we didn't have a networked printer in the past so it would be okay.Of course, once it arrived, connecting it to WiFi became my first obsession! I guess I just wanted to try it that cool new feature!I've never connected a printer to WiFi and wasn't sure how it worked. The printed materials that came with the printer were totally useless. It's all pictures, no words and nothing about connecting via Wifi. But, all the info you need, really, is on the printer screen. Even though it's tiny, I was able to get the information I needed from it to connect it up.Basically, I turned the printer on, read the directions as they scrolled across on the tiny screen and followed the directions. It mentioned a Lexmark printer app, which I downloaded. I was able to quickly and easily connect the app on my phone to the printer and from there it was a breeze. It went through the steps and I was able to print from my phone. Which again, was not something I had ever imagined doing, much less anything I needed or wanted to do. But it worked and that was cool!Then it was off to connect two computers to it. First I plugged it in by wire to my wife's computer - which I think might have been a mistake. But at the time I thought that's how you had to do it. For some reason I wasn't able to get it to connect via WiFi on her computer because while the computer ""saw"" the printer, it kept asking me for a WPS PIN which it said was either printed on the printer or was on the printed materials that came with the printer. It was on neither.I gave up on that and went to install it via WiFi only on my computer. Actually I didn't really have to do anything. I opened the Printer Settings on my computer and clicked Add Printer, then find WiFi connected printer and it was right there. So it was already broadcasting the signal to all devices in our house and all I had to do was click Connect - and it worked like a charm. The weird thing though is it didn't ask me for any WPS PIN for my computer. And I'm guessing that's because I never connected it via wire - so it didn't halfway install itself by wire only to get confused by WiFi? I don't know. But I did not ever attach it to my computer with a wire and the WiFi connected up absolutely flawlessly.Then I went back to my wife's computer and using the disk that came with the printer I installed the drivers from that. And once that was done, suddenly it worked fine as a WiFi printer. Although it shows up in Printer Settings as (copy1) of the first attempted installation by wire, which still works if it's plugged in with the wire.Then for the big test. I moved the printer to another room! Would we both be able to print on it from our respective offices? My wife's office is closest and mine is further away... about 50 feet away and several drywall walls. From my wife's office, everything went off without a hitch. From my office - same result. Print Perfect both times.My old $600 Brother printer did excellent color prints, and this one does as well - for 1/6th the price. I printed a few photos from the Lexmark, as a test, and was absolutely amazed at their quality. They're almost photo-printer quality. In fact, if I printed them on laser photo paper, I think they'd look good enough to frame and hang.The other nifty feature is the double-sided print feature. Maybe this is something that's been common among printers for the last few years, I'm not sure. But if you're not used to it, it's very cool. It will print on both sides of the paper - automatically. In other words, you don't have to print on one side and then stick the page in upside down and print the other side manually anymore. It will print the first side, then suck the page back into the printer and print the other side! It's really amazing to watch if you've never seen a printer do this before. And it's so fast.One other plus factor is that it's much smaller and lighter than our old printer. The old one, I literally can't lift by myself it's so darn heavy. Something around 100 pounds I think. But this one is much easier to lift, it's like a heavy suitcase. We also appreciate that it takes up much less space than the old behemoth did.One con so far... they include about 7 or 8 sheets of paper (printed on both sides - that's 16 pages of printing) with nothing other than safety warnings - in every imaginable language. The length of the English text wouldn't take up more than about 2 paragraphs, not even a full page. So it's a colossal waste of paper they include and completely unnecessary. Not to mention the hassle they cause all their customers with so much extra paper they have to throw out. BIG WASTE. I have to think that the United States is their largest market and as such might warrant it's own version of this in English and perhaps Spanish. But no... they literally had to print it in almost every major language on earth - and send it in every major language to every customer! Totally ridiculous, wasteful and annoying.The only instructions are what looks like a hand-drawn diagram with little arrows drawn here and there. Not a single word printed on these two pages - where words would be extremely helpful. Apparently the folks at Lexmark don't want to *offend* anyone by writing in the language/languages spoken in the United States only, so they opt not to print any words at all. As if instructions in English might offend people! Like the United States is such a small market it's not worth their time and effort to print in English and Spanish.Other than that big annoyance though, we're both very pleased with this purchase. I'm still amazed at all the complaints - and really surprised it has only a 3.7-star review score. That's way below where it should be in my humble opinion.I have seen some reviewers say it worked well at first but after a few weeks it went bad. So, if that happens here, I'll come back and definitely adjust my score accordingly, and revise my review to let you know."

We would like to highlight that our support team at 1-800-LEXMARK are highly skilled in these types of issues and are a wonderful resource to assist you with any future questions or issues you could experience. ,"I took a chance and got this printer based on the positive Amazon Vine reviews. The set up was a breeze, even using just the control panel and not the app. However, I tried printing a 20-page PDF that has a file size of 5mb. The printer could not process the PDF and would only print a single page and give me an error saying that the memory is full. So then I tried to just print two pages from the PDF, and it can't even handle that. If it can't print a multi-page document it is pretty worthless. And there is no way you can print 24 pages a minute if you have to print them one page at a time. If you just want to print a single page all the time, than this printer would be great for you, and the print quality was good. But if you need to print a multi-page document... you'll want to look somewhere else. Needless to say, I will be returning this and buying another HP or Brother printer.Update #1 - I spent a whole day trying to get this printer to work. I reinstalled it multiple times, restored factory settings, reset it up, updated the printer firmware, updated my operating system, and then finally figured out that if I installed it using generic post script printing and boom! it works. There was zero support on the Lexmark website. So they lose a star for that."

After being out on hold 6 times, the rep gave me a list of 3 YouTube videos to watch that “should” fix my problem. It didn’t. The QR Code that’s supposed to be easily scanned to connect your devices WILL NOT SCAN. I wasted two days trying to connect this piece of junk to my phone and it’s impossible."

The tiny config screen is dim and very hard to read. I have tried multiple drivers. It is just the WORST printer I have ever tried to connect wirelessly to WIndows. If you are going to use it by USB - go for it. Otherwise - you are only buying fustration.Update - I set it within a few feet of an a wireless access point and it was able to connect and stay connected. Wireless printers are known to have trouble establishing and keeping a wireless connection unless the card and the signal are strong - so this printer is acting like many wireless printers. Set it up as USB or Ethernet or close to access point and then share wirelessly."

As soon as it was set up it was obvious that the print quality was very poor. After contacting Lexmark and sending examples and details (SN, proof of purchase etc) of the printer, the initial diagnosis was a faulty toner cartridge. A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience. Its possible that if you happen to get a working printer, it might serve you well. But don't count on much in the way of support from Lexmark if you happen to get a dud."

R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,Vine Customer,4,MC3224adwe,N/A,39,0,No,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended."

The technician could not get the scanner to function with the Lexmark information supplied to the 3rd party support team.

I've wasted so much money on bad inkjet printers that clog over time not to mention all the ink cartridges. I run a small business and need a printer only sporadically for invoicing and bulk photo printing. The review...1. The setup was not without it's challenges. You just need to make sure that you connect the Wifi to the printer first through the printer control panel then proceed with downloading the appropriate drivers/apps for your device. I found it really easy to connect the devices actually. My Google phone and Chromebook latched on immediately. I could see how others could have issues figuring this out though. I'm fairly tech savvy but it still took me a few minutes of fiddling. I don't understand the lack of included instructions out of the box or online. You really just need a small note card that could walk you through it but nothing, weird. The printing software is nothing to write home about and typically no frills.2. Quality for text is very good of course since it's a laser. Photos are okay. They aren't as poppy or crisp as most inkjets in the same price range but it's passable, at least for my needs. I didn't expect too much for the photo printing (due to reviews I read) but it actually met or exceeded my expectations. If photos are your main interest then you shouldn't be looking at a laser anyway.3. Although this is compact compared to other laser printers, it's not exactly small. It takes up as much space as a small multifunction inkjet. The advantage is that I can shove this unit into a shelf because it doesn't have a scanner top that you need to lift. I realized over time that I use a scanner maybe once a year so I wanted forgo that function.Initially, I am super happy with this. The price is amazing!! It does exactly what I need it to do for use as a basic office printer. I've been buying inkjets all my life. I hope that I don't have to deal with clogged printer heads ever again. I was also weary of buying a 'Lexmark' since there is very little hype about this brand. But I love the no frills design and function of this unit. If I encounter issues then I will update this review. Otherwise, assume this thing is still kicking butt."

There is no software that installs with the printer making any setup that much harder. The instructions are non-existent, even if you can find something online. If you need functionality that should be common on any printer still on the market, skip this one and go with something newer. Shame on the vendor for not posting the age of the printer, which I found out later was last manufactured in 2015.Note: I called Lexmark tech support to attempt to get the scan setup working, and 1 hour later they still had no clue and gave up.

R31IRF6KKMLQOE,"October 7, 2019",Casysdavid,Verified Purchase,2,MC3224dwe,N/A,24,1,No,Revised after some miserable days of ownership - down from 4 stars,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31IRF6KKMLQOE?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,,"Update: This printer is a PITA! Freezes and won't respond to anything without power cycling. Paper jam error messages constantly - ""COMPLETELY REMOVE PAPER TRAY, CLEAR THE JAM..."" --- there is no paper jam. This happens following a power-up and nearly every time I use the paper bypass. I'm regretting the purchase. Otherwise, print quality is good and it's very fast. I do like the smallish footprint, but no doc feeder, no fax and too many interruptions to reset and clear imaginary jams...Original review:First off, I'm an engineer at an automation company and totally speak the language. Nonetheless, I nearly sent this printer back after starting to read faq and hunting through the HORRIBLE Lexmark site. I just didn't want to deal with a bunch of stress simply to setup a desktop printer. That said, it took me all of 5-minutes (Windows 10) to get things up and running: remove tape and tabs that are clearly indicated, load paper, power up and follow instructions on the touchscreen. I did not install the included CD software; I did not do any firmware update - it's working fine, so unless I find something, it'll likely stay this way. Every computer in our office group connected easily (Add Printer, found the Lex immediately, select ...done).This model (MC3224dwe) does NOT have fax; I assumed this was an ""all-in-one"" device which is how I started my search criteria: ""all in one color laser printer"". My fault for not reading specs carefully - Amazon search fails like this often and I know better. I purchased because of good reviews and price - so far, so good."

R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ,"July 29, 2019",Just Plain Larry,Vine Customer,3,MB2236adwe,N/A,158,1,No,3 stars and I'll explain in the review WHY only 3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,,"===Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.===Review begins:Just a heads up since some people may miss this. Monochrome= black and white printing ONLY. This is NOT a color laser printerThis has the POTENTIAL to be a great printer but there are several things that caused me to deduct pointsPROS:1. Good print speed. I did a 50 page double sided document in less than 2 minutes.2. 3 ways to connect. Wireless, Ethernet or USB3. Good scanning speed. I scanned a 20 page document in 40 seconds. And it WILL scan to a color document, it just won't PRINT in color.4. Compact and lightweight. At 16.5"" W x 13"" D x 14"" high it will fit almost anywhere. And at 16 pounds weight, it is a breeze to carry around. If you are old school like me, and you remember the early lasers that required 2 men, a horse and a hoist to put in place, you will appreciate the lightweight of this product5. Automatic Duplex Printing. You don't have to wait for it to print the odd numbered pages, and then reload the first prints for the even numbered pages. It automatically pulls the sheet back and prints the second side6. 250 page paper tray. Not nearly as much paper loading. And it handles letter and LEGAL size easily.6. At 5% toner lay down, you get crisp clear sharp text.7. Starter cartridge included.8. Built-n Web Server so you can check on status, jobs, level of supplies etc.9. It's multi-function so you can fax, scan, copy or print.10. When it's done for the day, it takes you out to dinner. OK not really, but it does a lot of things.So with all that, why only 3 stars you ask?1. The setup guide is a pictograph, not text.2. There is no manual included in the box or on the CD. I can understand not including a 187 page manual on paper, but they could have at least included the manual in PDF format on the CD. I had to go to support.lexmark.com to get the manual.3. It has a separate imaging unit from the toner cartridge. The unit is rated for 12,000 pages. We don't usually print that much in a year, but what about folks who print 3,000 pages a month? Every 4 months you will have to replace the imaging unit.4. And now, My BIGGEST gripe about this product. TONER COST!!!!!!!! Unless you are willing to participate in their Return program, which means you buy the cartridge and only use it once you can expect to pay $275-$350 for an extra high yield cartridge (6,000 pages) and from $90-$150 for a regular cartridge (1,200 pages) . And even on the return program for a regular yield (1,200 pages) they start at $48 depending on where you shop for it.Between having to replace toner, and having an external imaging unit, I don't care that it takes you out for dinner (again, just kidding). The operating costs for this product are too high for every day usage except in a small office. I was hoping to retire my old HP 1020, but that isn't going to happen until the consumable costs come way down. This printer is a fairly new release, so it is hard to find remanufactured consumables yet.So if you can overlook the consumables cost, then this is a good printer for daily use, even if it is not economical to use. The output is clear and sharp. Scanner works great. I did not test the fax since our fax server is in another room from the printer. Fast printing. Fast scanning. Wi-Fi enabled. Mid-point price range. Ethernet ready. USB Front port for printing from a flash drive. Network capable. USB Ready as well. Color control panel that's large enough to work with. Compact design and weight.But I am still only giving it 3 stars for the consumables cost.End of Review===Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

I finally decided to go with this one because it seems all printers get bad reviews but this one didn't seem to be too bad. I received my first one very quickly and I was very excited. I opened it and saw that the scanning bed was cracked. So, back in the box it went. Mind you, this is a heavy machine and it's not easy to pack it up, etc. I requested a new one to be sent to me.The second machine took longer to get to me but I got it in about 3 days. I got it out of the box and got it set up. I connected it to my internet and thought things would be realitively each. No such luck. You have to down load an app to your phone to be able to print from your phone. I do a LOT of printing from my phone or Ipad. So, I down load the app and it can't find the printer even though they are on the same network. After getting the manual off of HP website and doing some searching, I realize it's because one of the settings is wrong. Sorry - I can't remember the setting now and I don't have the printer any longer. So, I set the indicator and it seems my phone sees the printer. Yea! So, I go to send a document to the printer. It's about a 10 page document. My current deskjet would hardly take any time to print this type of document. I waited and waited, etc.... The printer kept saying it was receiving the document but wasn't printing. After about 30 minutes, I decided to try to set up the software on my printer. Of course, in the middle of setting up the software, the printer decided to 'start' printing my document but only printed about a quarter of one page and that is all I ever saw it print.So, I decided to try to concentrate on getting my computer set up. Again, my deskjet was never an issue. Find the printer and start printing. I updated the software and tried to print a document again from my computer. I kept getting communication errors between my computer and the printer. The printer was online the whole time and so was my computer. Mind you this went on for a few hours one night and into the next day.When I finally think something is printing, it printed a small box and then I got a firmware error. So, I went to look for an update. Again, you have to connect thru your computer to the printer using the computer number. The printer was showing me the number but everytime I tried to access it, it would time out. I tried this for a few hours. This is the only way I could find in the manual to actually update the firmware on the printer, but since I could not get to the actual menu, I couldn't update it.By this time, I'm fed up. So, I decided in the end to just return the second machine also. Please keep in mind, that I work in IT. I'm not a hardware person, but I can figure out most things if I have instructions. I don't know how they expect anyone to get this working without support. Yes, I could have called for help and it might have been resolved, but I don't like to have to call for help. It should have been working or easily fixed when I connected."

It was very inexpensive and with laser you don't really have to worry about cartridges drying out. After unpacking and removing the shipping protectors the printer kept complaining about shipping materials inside the cartridges. I kept looking for stuff to remove to no avail. I called support and i was told that this is a common problem with this printer, and they will rma it and send me a new one, and i will send this back. Well a week after the call the support rep keeps telling me that the tracking numbers will be available in 2 days. This has been going on for about a week now and no tracking numbers. I am ready to return this unit to amazon and be done with this brand. The only reason i got this is because it was very inexpensive, and with our usage the printer will be obsolete before the starter cartridges will be out."

There is no manual on how to set it up. There was no drivers included in the box. When I tried to scan a document the scanning feature required a password that was not provided nor could I reprogram. I went online to watch videos on how to install drivers and how to install the intitial settings. The only video on youtube or on Lexmark's website was how to remove the tape from the printer. This unbelievable. I cannot believe how stupid I was trying to save 50.00. If I live to be 150 years old I will never by a Lexmark product again. I feel humiliated by buying this product.

Love the color, clarity, and ease of changing the cartridges. This is the best design... just pull open a drawer from the front, and they are laying in there in order. Lift and replace. No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem. The printer has a noise level when printing (and did quiet when not) however, its not much different from the Brother laser printer it replaced and is less noisy than an ink jet. For its price point and functionality - it is no problem."

RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,3,MB2236adw,N/A,66,6,No,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGZ49J58DX0W5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."

To the point of way past frustration I was packing it up to return to Amazon and almost printed out the return labels, I wanted to return the printers. The Software seemed to be stuck wanting me to set up SMTP mail servers address and continued to post errors every time I tried to print. 2 calls to Lexmark help got me nowhere. I walked away from it for a day and then ended up removing all of the Lexmark software and used the Printer IP address and went into the Printer Config screen and set up to match my old printer IP address and it works fine using the Lexmark Universal v2 XL driver.

I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking. I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome. However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work. Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error. I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message! The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now."
R3M22TBFV1XCXW,"May 24, 2019",Paula Coody,Verified Purchase,2,B2236dw,N/A,3,0,No,I do not recommend this printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M22TBFV1XCXW?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,,"I am again amending my review. I have had this printer less than one year, and the duplex feature has broken. The printer still tries to force duplexing often, but as it goes to pull the paper back in after printing the first side, it jams every time. I cannot turn off the double-sided printing on the printer (and have it stay that way). I have to remember every time I print (which is a big time-waster) to turn it off.-------------------I am amending my review after using this printer for awhile. I changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars. It takes some getting used to.I was used to just putting things in the manual feed slot (checks, envelopes, special paper, etc.) and my old printer would always auto-select it when it sensed something there. This one, you need to make sure your print option is manual feed to avoid problems/jams.It still always defaults to duplex when I don't want it, making my print twice sometimes and waste more paper than its green ""enviro-leaf"" symbol is trying to save, but oh well, the wacky world we live in now.---------------------------------[old review below]I run a busy small office. I keep a printer on my desktop for small jobs, printing checks, and envelopes, and I send large jobs to my network printer. I have used this printer for a few weeks now.First the good:This printer is fast and the print quality is good.The bad:1. The separate single feed slot that I use for checks and envelopes doesn't draw well and has to be almost always separately selected when a job is sent to print. It jams all the time. A big waste of time and this problem alone means that I would never recommend this printer.2. When regular letter-sized paper is put in the main tray, you have to open the rear door of the printer (like you were using over-sized paper) and leave it open, else the main tray won't fit in.3. I don't duplex much of my work, but it keeps reverting to duplexing after every time I change the settings (I guess it's trying to force ""saving the planet"" on me, instead of allowing me to use it how best works for my business)"

I got tired of paying $100/yr maintaining a full set of color ink that seems to have a countdown timer once it's opened whether you use it or not. I'm also tired of the financially motivated engineering decision to prevent printing with the Black cartridge only in the guise of needing color to produce a better B&W print. If you're tired of these same things, buy this printer! It's fantastic and for the price ($70 on sale) I don't know any that are better. Print quality is excellent, it's wireless AND it's got a built-in duplexer. That alone makes it a steal!Note: I was not sponsored or offered any discount for my review.

RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,Verified Purchase,4,MB2236adw,N/A,3,0,No,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYUB0RC2X96PZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."
