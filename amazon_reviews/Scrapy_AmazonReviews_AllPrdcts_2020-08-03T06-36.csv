R308V8ELPTPG08,"July 30, 2020",James M. Mcguire,3,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Printer is working but it's a returned printer.,"While setting printer up I noticed a few things that were not right. The tabs that you are required to remove for each color and black printing were missing. Next, when I opened the paper tray, there was paper already in it. When I went through the setup, I found it had already been set up once before in May of this year (this is July). Clearly, I didn't get the NEW printer I had ordered. The WiFi setup was harder than any other printer I have used to date (I've set up 5 since WiFi was an option), but I finally got it working. Print quality is OK for B/W text but not dark and uniform when using large fonts. The user manual was missing but I downloaded it on a PDF. Oh yeah, there was no registration card for warranty purposes. We'll see how hard it will be to register it online.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R308V8ELPTPG08?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R3LQOVVEX25D52,"July 16, 2020",kmt22,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Not good,"I did not believe the one star reviews mixed 50/50 with five star reviews - I wish I had. I bought this to use with Android phones in my household. If this printer works well, it must only be for certain phone types. This review is for use with the LGV50 ThinQ and Samsung Note 8.- Documentation is inadequate or non-existent. It's enough to get cartridges installed and printer turned on. After that, virtually no online reference to this specific printer exists, whether it be detailed manuals, online forums discussing specific problems, mobile drivers, etc. The only ""support"" that is useful is this page of Amazon customer reviews.- Wireless setup is cumbersome but not impossible. I was able to connect to my home wifi and produce a Wi-Fi direct network using the front panel. Feels like texting did in the year 2003, tapping each character out. It's easy to set a static IP address if desired, but this made no improvement in my ability to connect.- Due to wireless connectivity issues, I purchased a USB-B to USB-C cable. That's right, this does not support multi use USB and requires the ancient square USB type which I specially ordered on Amazon. No USB cables were supplied with my printer.- The Lexmark app from the Google play store specifically does not support this model of printer. I was able to load my doc but in the end, no connection to the printer. That leaves third party apps only.- Printers could be set up and available in my printer apps, but when selected, the printer is always ""unavailable right now."" Even when the printer happened to recognize a connection which I accepted on its front panel, the app would return ""internal printer error."" It takes over an hour of cycling apps and connection types to finally get a connection. I have had intermediate success with Samsung Print Service (even on my LG phone) and NoKo Print (over USB only). I have never been able to print from Lexmark Print or Mopria (supposed to be the universal standard of mobile print drivers with a consortium of manufacturers).- Note that print is only possible for photos and pdfs. Do not expect to print a webpage or other content without making a pdf first, unless specifically supported by the app.- The buffer is small. It will print one page, pause, print the next, pause. This takes up a lot of time for multi page documents.- Print quality is as expected from a cheap laser printer. Relatively crisp depending on the document. Occasionally get a thin red stripe down one side of the page. Pictures are ok, not great.- The thing weighs 50 pounds. How can I return that?? Get a strong desk or stand.In the end, this printer will let you down. If you are unlucky enough that your device doesn't play nicely, there is no remedy. I spend around an hour fighting with the printer each time I need something, usually an important form or tax document. Sometimes I just give up. And it doesn't even have a scanner, so it has no redeeming qualities. Save your money and go to a brick and mortar store to purchase a printer that is known to work with mobile devices. They cost more because they WORK. I am sorry I bought this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LQOVVEX25D52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

The price was right and Lexmark does have a good reputation. While the quality of printing and copying is good the software interface is just awful. It's clear that the lexmark programmers are sloppy and just not in tune with reality. User instructions are poor, and even the online stuff is bad. The printer is constantly going into ""offline"" mode and there is no way to change that except to unplug the device. You can;t even power down and then up again to reset it. You actually have to disconnect the power cord. So dumb. The scanner/copier feeder is also poor in that it can only handle about 5 pages otherwise it gets jammed.Scanning is also another issue as you actually have to set up the email account on the printer to get it to work or use a USB stick. Also dumb.

R16KJZQTOTLVJC,"July 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,1,MC3326adwe,Verified Purchase,toner costs more than the printer,"I print a lot, and I knew that I would be changing out an ink cartridge every week at the rate I print. I wanted a color printer since I do print documents and articles with color prints and images. Instead of an inkjet I decided to buy this laser printer, anticipating it would be cheaper in the long run than inkjet. I was wrong. After the 2nd week of having it I ran out of black toner which the printer informed me was low. I ordered the toner ($90 by the way), you have to order it since it is not sold in stores, (tried staples, best buy, office max, walmart, target, costco, etc). After the toner arrived I installed it and tried to print but it would not print since now the color toners were out. It did not mention that. I thought ok, I will only print in black and white or grayscale until I can get the color toner replaced. NOPE it will not print if any toner is out. I look up the color toner to purchase and it cost $100 MORE than the printer cost!!! I should have looked at that before buying the printer but I did not expect it to be so expensive. It is now a VERY expensive paperweight, as I refuse to pay more for my toner than for my printer. I ended up buying an inkjet, and although I will probably spend more money in the long run, I live paycheck to paycheck, I can purchase a $30 ink cartridge here and there, I can not drop $350 all at one time for toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KJZQTOTLVJC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,3,0,No,

R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ,"July 20, 2020",So disappointed,5,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,Amended review,"I purchased this printer after a great deal of long research. I broke my beloved canon and had been wanting to buy a color laser for over a year, and I purchased it after reviews from Amazon. I was aware the toner would not last very long, the estimate ranged from 200-300 pages, but the yellow toner ran out after only a few pages, and the printer would not print except in black without two yellow streaks down the side of the page. Prior to that, the print quality was fantastic -- it was super easy to set up - my computer did all the work -- it is connected to my printer via a cord, so I'm not doing any wireless printing -- I'm old, and I print mainly from digitals stored in my computer, so wireless is not a necessity for me -- Even though the printer was advertised as ""new"" I was concerned it had been returned -- I contacted Amazon via chat, and the young man that resolved my issue could not have been more helpful -- I could not find any generic or after-market cartridges such as ones available for canon and HP. I finally found replacement Lexmark cartridges from a company called quill.com -- at the most reasonable price I could find -- it was still $80, but it's supposed to last for roughly 600 pages -- this is the recycling program, which I like -- you could buy a cartridge with longer life for about $20 more -- also, I watched videos on youtube about replacing the toner powder at home and then resetting the printer chip -- you can buy toner for about $13 -- that may be an avenue I experiment with -- but as far as ease of use and print quality, I love it very much -- I make journals and one of the downfalls is, if you get a drop of water on an inkjet image, the whole page is ruined because it will smear -- I've had mono laser printers since the 1990's, so I knew if you act quickly, it could be saved -- when the printer arrived, I did a lot of water tests, and was very pleased with the results. Now that I know I can find cartridges at a reasonable cost, I'm much happier -- if you purchase from this seller, contact them prior to shipping -- shipping was delayed, and I still wonder if this was a returned printer -- so get sales person's name and write down exactly what they tell you.

R1CLTKNQSPQYOF,"July 19, 2020",Donald V. Rutkowski Jr.,1,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,The scanner functional is not efficient.,"The printer was easy to setup and I was printing paper within minutes. Now the scanner part, is a whole different story. After spending about 4 to 5 hours trouble shooting the scanner issue, I finally figured out how to scan from the printer to the computer and its not efficient at all.First you have to download the ""Lexmark Scanback Utility"", which is not part of the original driver package. Once you install and start running the utility, you will create a scanner profile. Second, you have to go back to the printer, load the paper you want to scan, then select the scanner profile you created. Once that is all done, you have successfully scanned your document.

It's not too difficult. The printer arrived where the carton appeared to be in excellent condition. The unit is well padded, and plenty of security tape to keep doors, trays and lids in place during shipping. Getting the printer up and running was easy for both the Mac and PC systems. The catch with this printer is the paper tray. The tray isn't the best solution in the printer industry. Considering the printer is 50 lbs. in weight, I'd assume the paper tray would have been constructed with metal guides and a solid tray solution. Not the case, it is all plastic. The tray and the printer paper *pick up function* didn't work well right out of the box. Of several 10's of sheets of different paper, none of the paper used would be successfully drawn from the tray to be printed. The printer *pick up function* from the tray was inadequate, with only one sheet out of 20+ attempts to print with this printer.Paper used: HP Premium 20 lb. paper HP Premium 24 lb. paper HP Premium 32 lb. paper HP Mulitpurpose 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Paper 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Plus 20 lb. paperThe tray filled with each of the different paper types, filed at full capacity, half capacity, near empty capacity... the results were the same. Every type of paper would begin its journey as the *pick up mechanism* would extract about 2 inches of the top sheet, then slice two one inch tears into the edge of the paper. The printer would report the *tray out of paper.* Clearly there's something wrong with this printer, at least the one received. The remedy to clear the ""out of paper"" error was to remove the tray, remove the damaged top sheet, then install the tray, and do the same thing over, and over, and over again.The price for a scanner, printer, fax, copier machine is reasonable, but if it doesn't work, it's a waste of time.The other Lexmark printer owned for several months/years is the model C2535.

This compact color MFP can fit almost anywhere. (13. 6 x 16. 2 x 15. 5 inches / 344. 4 x 411. 2 x 394. 1 mm), according to its makers. It is also, according to its makers, easy to use: its makers claim that it is plug it in and ready to go. Furthermore, they add that its standard wi-fi makes it easy to print from mobile devices.That it is interconnective: its 2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information. That it will enable the user to scan to network, email, FTP, or USB stick drive, scan to, print files from popular cloud services with Lexmark's Cloud Connector, while providing security. That its extra high yield unison toner will provide up to 4, 500 pages of output, so the user can print more, stop less. And it is durable, as its steel frame, long-life imaging components mean it’s built to last. So the user can get solid performance, get things done with a 1-GHz dual-core processor, output up to 26 ppm. The manufacturers also state that the printer, with its Unison Toner, will deliver rich, vibrant color with crisp details, for outstanding quality. The manufacturers also claim that this printer will deliver media flexibility, enabling the user to get universal media handing from A6 to legal; support for specialty media like envelopes, optional input expandable up to 751 pages. Form Factor: All-In-One; paper Size: 8.5 X 11.So, OK, to begin with,at 50 lbs., I would call it heavy; I needed help to get it off my front porch, though I was comforted by the idea that most thieves probably couldn’t lift it either. Then, setting it up is anything but easy: the makers offer a coupla pages of weird diagrams, no written instructions, and a CD. Whose computer has CD portals anymore? Then, it doesn’t print pictures, to those of you who might want to. And it needs lithium batteries which are difficult to fit, pricey. But my main problem with it was my difficulty in figuring out the scan function, which is not even listed on its index of available functions. ( And, by the way, its touch screen is tiny.) And figuring out how to scan was difficult even with the help of my professional computer guru.

R8Z4KZYQ63GSK,"May 26, 2020",S. Brown,2,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,no documentation and heavier than most printer stands can take,"I was excited to be offered to test and review this printer. Most of the places I’ve worked at have had Lexmark printers as they are such workhorses. But I haven’t personally owned one and so never had to try to set one up before.First thing you need to know is that this printer is HEAVY. It comes in at 50 pounds. And until I got this, I had no idea that almost all printer stands will only support a printer of 30 pounds. It took me awhile to find a stand that would be big enough (it also has a larger footprint than my previous printers) and sturdy enough and rated to handle the weight of this. After I found one and ordered it, I was contacted by the seller, in very broken English, asking me to please cancel the order because they really didn’t have any stands! After many more hours of searching, I gave up on printer stands and found instead a “roll cart with drawers” (no longer available) that was big enough and rated to hold the weight. After it finally arrived, I then had to assemble it and wait for the glue to dry before I could use it.So now the printer is on the stand and I am ready to set it up. Not. There are no directions or manual or any real info with this. All it came with are several pages of pictures showing you how to remove all the tape and packing material in, on and around the printer. The only other thing they show is putting the CD into your computer. I tried that. It did NOTHING. The CD does not have a manual or info or anything like that on it. Instead it appears to be a program that will auto install the drivers and optionally some utilities. However, you have to first have the printer on your wifi.There are NO directions or information on how to connect to your wifi. On all of my previous wifi printers, they came with detailed, step by step directions that were easy to follow. This printer leaves you to figure it out yourself. First issue is the password.The touch screen “buttons” you need to press to enter your password as so tiny that I found it impossible to know if I pressed the right one. This is due to the fact that the screen does not show you what you pressed! Not even momentarily. Nope, it gives you nothing but asterisk. Maybe if I had a short password, it would be ok, but ours is very long and a mix of letters and numbers. I tried repeatedly, but it would not work for me. After a few more days I found an old rubber tipped stylus and that helped. They next problem was with our router (I didn’t have anything to do with the purchase of this or it’s setup – it is NOT one I would have chose).I finally seemed to have gotten the right combination of “buttons” on the printer and the router pushed and with the stylus, the right characters for the password input and it connected to wifi. Running the CD was easy and I did install one of the optional programs.You would think all is fine finally and I would be able to use the printer. And you would be wrong. I thought I would start by scanning in some art that I recently finished. On almost every printer I’ve worked with before, there would be a “button” for “print”, “fax”, “copy”, and “scan”. Nothing so simple on this one. The only “scan” option says “scan profiles”. Since there are no instructions for anything, I push that. Big mistake evidently. The printer locked up. It was completely non-responsive.After 30 minutes, I gave up and pulled the plug. That seemed to reset it from the beginning when I first turned it on. It did however, remember the network and connect itself without my intervention. It takes several minutes to get itself ready. Now I no longer have the “scan properties” option.So this time I decided to try printing from the cloud. I signed into One Drive through Word and saved this document. Went to the printer and selected One Drive. It makes me give it a name for some weird reason then tells me I have to go to a website and read pages of legalese and agree then input a code. I did all of that and found myself at a sign in to One Drive. Weird. I just signed in. So I sign in here and see nothing for me to do and can not find the cloud storage from here. It just got me to my account info with Microsoft.I go back to the printer, figuring I did what it said so I was good to go. NOT. The printer is showing me the code again and telling me I have to go agree and input the code on the website. Round and round we go. I again hit ok. BTW, before you can type that URL in and connect, the printer will flip screens so you have to again click several times to get back to the code so you can type it in. I again agree, and again am set to sign in with Microsoft. This time, MS asks if I want to let my printer have access to my cloud. Amongst the things I expected, for some reason Lexmark also is saying it has to have full access to my profile. Not sure why it would need that to print but I don’t save much to the cloud so I don’t really need to be concerned – I hope.So, I grant access and end up back at Lexmark which now has a message that I am ALMOST done. That now that it is set up, I HAVE to print from the cloud within 72 hours or it will delete all of this info and I have to start all over again. Fine. Whatever. I select the cloud and the named profile and find my directory tree as in OneDrive. Choose something to print and not sure what to do next. I take a chance and press the arrow and it prints. So that at least seems to work as advertised after you jump through the hoops.Print quality was excellent and the photos and illustrations came out fantastic. There was no banding in the gradients and the colors were good. Very pleased with this part of the printer.I can’t find any options to scan except scan to cloud. That is extremely disappointing. I don’t see why there isn’t a scan to computer option like all my other printers have had. That makes an extra step for me. Scan to cloud, go to cloud to retrieve. Why? That is just dumb. I guess they figure you only use this for business and not for ever using with photos or graphics that need repair or retouch/rework in a program on your computer.So my low rating is mainly due to the lack of documentation. I have lots of options when I click on things but no idea what they mean or do. I don’t really have the time to sit and hit all the buttons to see what happens. I have things I need it to do and simply want to know how to do them. I shouldn’t have to first figure it out on my own.-------------It is now August 2020 and I have been online and found the documentation. While it is helpful, the printer still requires you to jump through a ton of hoops to do everything except a straight print from computer.I use my printers to scan in documents and this is NOT easy on this printer. It can be done but with many many unneeded steps in comparison to EVERY single printer I have ever owned.You have to open the scan utility. I had to download that software and install first. Then you have to pick what size document you want to scan. Fine. You would think that would be it. That the printer would be smart enough for you to select this ONCE and done. Then if you needed to make a change, you would go back and change it. NO doesn't work like that.You have to give it a profile name. That name is then sent to the printer under the very unintuitive menu item of ""shortcuts"". Then you click on shortcuts and then your name and then it will do it. However it will always use the same path name and same file name for every time. NOT useful.To make it work, I set up two different profile ""shortcuts"" (interesting that they don't both appear on the printer - only the one at a time). Then I make a desktop shortcut. One is for legal sized and one is for letter. It will not print any larger than letter, but it will scan larger.So I pick either the letter or the legal desktop shortcut I made. It gives me a dialog box on the computer that I MUST answer NO to in order for this to work. if I answer yes, the scans will always over write each other. only THEN can I go over to the printer, wake it up by pushing the arrow ""button"", wait until it gives me the screen and find ""shortcuts"" then the name of the ""profile"". I forget what it is called, but I think it is just scan. I can't get it confused because I only ever see the one associated with the desktop shortcut!Then I put the item on the glass and push the arrow button again and it scans.what a huge PITA. I have never had to jump through so many hoops to do almost everything with a printer. It insists that you create profiles and each one has to have a name before it will do anything. But every time I look, there are no profiles listed in the menu. Very odd. You have to jump through this naming garbage to use the cloud print or scan also.I guess you could say I love/hate this thing. It works well, just it is a royal pain to use.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8Z4KZYQ63GSK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,2,1,No,

This Lexmark is a step up from the quality that I’m used to from them. The construction doesn’t feel as cheap or shoddy, and it actually feels like a fairly solid printer. I like that they’re upping the quality for home laser printing. I much prefer laser quality over ink, and they have not disappointed in that regard. The toner replacement seems a little steep, but if you’re getting 4500 pages as opposed to 500, it can average out.That being said, the touch screen is a little too small for my fingers, and makes it difficult to use. The setup is pretty straight forward and easy with no real surprises if you have any kind of familiarity with printer set up. Which is good, because the “manual” that comes with it doesn’t really explain anything.

R2T03U91SZ94NP,"May 19, 2020",Jon R,1,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, hampered by terrible software","The short version: Don’t bother with this, while the hardware is good it’s paired with terrible software that ruins the experience. You can get much better for the same price, in fact it’s actually on the upper end of what I’d consider reasonable pricing. You can probably get the same or better for even less if you look for sales.Longer version:As I said the printer hardware is nice. It’s not too big for a color laser, prints clearly on every paper type, is fairly quiet, and fast. I’d give the hardware a 4/5 if Lexmark could hire someone who knew anything about software to fix the garbage software this thing runs.Now first let me side track a bit because this needs mentioning. The instructions that come with this are ridiculous. You get a about 7 pages of paper with no words, just photos (poor ones at that) and a CD. Honestly, who still has a CD drive on their computer? If they want to throw one in, fine, but they also need a thumb drive or just tell you where to go to download manuals and let you know to do it online. The good news is those do exist, but you have to go to Lexmark’s website and find it yourself. I work in IT, so I knew how to setup a printer, but not everyone does. Those pictures (I’m not even going to call them instructions) are not going to help anyone.Now with that out of the way back to my reason for rating this printer low despite the nice hardware. The crap software. So the first thing I ran into was the printer suggested using an app to set it up faster. That’s cool, other printer have done that and it can be easier then trying to set it up on those small screens. Except this app just doesn’t work. For one thing it’s about as bare bones as you can get, and looks like it hasn’t been updated in years (and the update notes suggest it hasn’t, they only added support for newer printers). It couldn’t find the printer, which is expect during setup but it gave no instruction on how to connect to the printer. I finally got it to see the printer by using my phone’s WiFi direct. Except the app, either due to poor design or a bug, did not do any setup it went right to the main screen, and once again complained about not finding the printer. I gave up on that and decided to do it on the printer itself. I don’t think even the most petite persons fingers could type on that keypad. It took several tries to get the passwords to match because you can't see what you are typing, so I kept making typos. Next up was WiFi. Connecting to the network took a few tries, again, because there are not clear instructions included nor onscreen instructions. Once I was connected, it worked but again I am in IT and know about these things. Someone not in IT probably would have a harder time. Now begins another annoying adventure - I get through the needlessly annoying setup and arrive at the main screen. Several things have a lock beside them so I try to enter my password from earlier to unlock them, and it doesn’t work. I guess I might have typed it wrong since the keypad is so hard to use. So I go into settings and find the option to do a factory reset, nothing happens when I tap it. After some frustration I realize you have to restart the printer for the reset to happen – why wouldn’t it tell me that? Ok annoying setup again, this time I say screw the password and just make it 12345, it’s not like anyone else has access to this. Ok good news is that the password works now. Now the thing has the wrong region? What? It doesn’t let me change it either. I tried ANOTHER reset and during setup the region was STILL locked to the wrong location. After much frustration I found it can be changed via the web interface. FINALLY the printer is ready to use.First thing I try is via my phone since I have it with me. I try their app, because the app for my HP printer had been handy. Lexmark’s app is as useless as that setup app, bare bones, and outdated. I just decided to use Android’s printing and that worked. Next up my iPad. Since this is an Airport printer I decided to use that. Well, Airport was a no-go, it could never connect. I tried their iOS app and it was no better then their Android one. So basically it’s a no-go for iOS printing. And final my Windows PC. Their Windows software is trash like the rest. Windows couldn’t find the printer without Lexmark’s crap software. But I used the old manual printer setup to manually enter the IP and it was able to connect and print.See the pattern here? Lexmark should hire some high school kid to go and recode all their software, because it’s obvious nobody there knows how to do it. When you factor in the headaches this terrible software will give you, this printer is not worth the price.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T03U91SZ94NP?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,1,2,No,

R2LG9CZCCKIY1W,"June 21, 2020",Matt P.,4,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Excellent, Fast Printing In A Heavy Plastic Housing","Lexmark is known to make some excellent printers, both large and small, for business and home use. This model could be used easily for a home office, and for a small business that needs high quality prints. Set up on this is easy and straightforward, and can be used with WiFi or Ethernet. App is available for WiFi set up. i was very disappointed in the touch screen, where all your settings and options are found. This Lexmark sells for $259.00 (as of this review), and for that money, if it's gonna have a touch screen, it should be at least big enough to see the text, and definitely big enough for your fingers to be able to use it. The description states ""2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information"". I hardly believe it to be ""convenient interaction"" at all, when I had to enter my password for WiFi, literally, I had to do it like 5 times. I know my password, but the keyboard is so small, even my smaller fingers had a tough time landing on the touch key correctly, and hitting the right letter or number. There's plenty of real estate on here that another inch would not have interfered with anything, and made a world of difference. The price of screens like this has pretty much dropped to rock bottom, they are so widely produced, so don't understand. I have a $69 Canon that has a touch screen at least 50% bigger, and much easier to use than this.As others have stated, the paper tray is a little flimsy, not falling apart flimsy, but not as exact as I thought it would be. The entire housing looks like it's made of plastic (it states it has a metal frame), and although that in itself is not bad, it's just some parts, like the tray, could have used a little more support, and sliding in and out, it could have used a sturdier slide than what it has. If I had bought a printer for under $100 bucks (which there are more than enough of those to choose from, and getting better quality every day), this is what I would expect. As far as the main feature, and what this is built for, printing, it's excellent. Prints are sharp, even the smallest print. Pictures are color perfect, even at 8x11, they look great. All print out quickly, and to me, quietly. I know some have stated this is a loud printer. The only times I notice it is loud was the initial setup, and if it's been totally shut down. I leave mine on standby, and pretty much just makes a kind of fan running sound when it's printing, quiet to me, and then goes back to sleep until I wake it again. FYI: This is a printer only. I think a lot of people (like my wife too, was wondering where you lift up to scan and make a copy, it doesn't, this is a one trick pony, but it's excellent at it. If you are looking for a high quality printer function only, for professional looking work, this can do the job. It's also expandable to a second tray if you need to do a lot of printing. Toner is not cheap, depending on where you shop I guess. Average price I found, for the black cartridge only, was about $100 bucks, at a very well known national office supply company. But, printer toner is known to vary wildly in price, and tomorrow it could be $19.99, who knows. Overall, an excellent printer, in a good looking, VERY heavy, plastic housing. If you don't care about anything else about this printer, except that you want perfect, professional looking print, at a reasonably priced small office printer, this is your man (printer). Lexmark makes great printers, this is one of them, and my only major gripe was the screen, and the paper tray a minor gripe. Other than that, even my other printer I had for a few years because it always performed so well (from a very well known company that also makes good printers, and sold for around the same price as this), didn't print as well as this when it came to precision print. For the price, I'm impressed with the print, and worth the asking price (especially if they decide to do something with that screen!)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LG9CZCCKIY1W?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,

I connected it manually via the touchscreen, worked just fine but a bit tedious entering in the wifi password as it requires running through entire numbers and alphabet. It does allow for scrolling through so it didn't take too long - just a different process via the touch screen.Very fast printing. I'd say the printing speed is the best feature. Two-sided ejects the paper then draws it back in for the second side printing. There's a little stop-paper shield to keep the paper from flying off the top of the printer but we haven't needed to use that yet as all the print jobs have been small. There's an additional paper tray for larger paper. The main letter sized paper tray is in front, easy to fill, and fits flush with the printer.This printer is a big heavier than most probably due to the large ink cartridge. It's a bit noisier than I expected.Comes with picture only instructions sheet and a DVD.Works well for a home or small business. There's Apps that can be downloaded either Apple or Android phones.I downloaded the Apps but was able to just print from my phone email. However, on one of our laptops we kept getting an error code.

RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",V-TEAM,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,3,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively.

They aren't sold on amazon that I could find (or anywhere else for that matter). I think I ordered the correct thing on the Lexmark website, but it cost me over $120. I personally can't afford a replacement cartridge every month at that price. On top of that, the website reads that there are only ""5 items left in stock,"" which I assume is now 4 that I just ordered one.

RH9GU757CDJQ9,"June 28, 2020",Jimster480,4,B3340dw,Vine Customer,A fast printer with an easy setup but a weird amount of network usage,"I setup this printer to replace my 6 year old $50 laser that has been chugging along faithfully. I've tested out a few other printers in the last months but this one is my favorite so far.The Good:- Has double sided printing (has to be a 2 page + document though)- Very fast printing (wake up to print time is around 14 seconds, only around 4 seconds if its on ""sleep"") and definitely hits its 40ppm claim. I did print out over 20 sheets for my son (single sided) in one clip and it was done in under 1 minute (including warm up time from ""sleep).- The printer Has Ethernet and a screen where everything can be setup without a PC even if it takes a little while on the 2 line screen. I was able to plug it into my network and get it working via the printer only in about 5 minutes.- Print Quality is very good; much better than my old $50 laser which is impressive considering how fast it spits the pages out!- Large Paper Tray; Holds 250 sheets and actually has a meter that tells you how much paper there is (in 3 different tiers of full, Nearly Full, OK) in the printer. Paper tray can be adjusted to various different types of paper so cards and other smaller formats can be printed.- Has a 50 sheet bypass tray in the back for separate paper types.- Drivers make it easy to setup duplexing and paper sizes.- Allows for PIN based print and hold features for offices; so users can print confidential documents that they will need to enter a pin to physically print out (printer will hold the print job in memory until it is retrieved).- Supports PCL5e; great for workgroups and other network printing scenarios.- Supports Wifi-Direct; this allows for direct printing from laptops or mobile devices without needing to be on the local network. You can enable to disable this in the options menu.- Supports Google Cloud Print: It can be toggled with a single button in the operator menu.- Super easy website user interface; Every area has easy drop down options and even firmware can be easily updated with a couple clicks via this page (printer local IP address). Check the included image to see what the page looks like.- Supports 500+ page paper trays or multiple paper trays. There is a whole family of printers from Lexmark that share paper trays; giving you many options to expand your paper capacity if need be.Cons- Has a coil whine that repeats 2x/second when its on ""sleep"" mode; must put printer into hibernate (which takes between 30-40 seconds to wake up) to make this go away.- Default windows driver install on a ""detected"" printer only contains the MAC address and not the name of the printer. Also has weird printing limitations and doesn't work properly. Drivers from the website are required to fix this.- 2 Line screen has poor viewing angles requiring you to be over the top of the printer to view it.- Rear Bypass tray requires Printer to not be near a wall. You need a full foot + behind the printer to be able to use it. Making it pretty useless in most applications since the power, ethernet, USB connections are around the bypass tray.- Uses a bunch of data on the network; I logged over 300MB in a day of data transfer without any printing. This seems to happen even when its on hibernate. My other printers use less than 1MB a day of data. I am not sure why this printer keeps sending 200kb every minute or so.Conclusion:I think I will be keeping this one to use it for my kids. Toner prices are decent with 3000 page toner cartridges available for under $90 (at the time of writing) and 1500 page ones available under $60.Considering the price of toner for some other printers on the market; this is both affordable and competitive.Overall this is a great printer for the money; it is very fast, prints with great quality and has a smaller form factor. Unlike other printers I have tested; this one I can actually recommend. It seems to also go on sale pretty frequently; meaning that you might be able to pick it up at an even better deal than the regular price.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful!

Come to find out, Lexmark's software has some kind of ""problem"" with COMCAST (and one other ISP whose name I can't recall) as an internet service provider. You have to CALL Lexmark and talk to a technician to get the software patch. I found this out on a Friday night at 6 p.m. Lexmark does not provide tech support on evenings or weekends!!! So I was stuck until Monday, and I really NEEDED this printer. Monday morning I dutifully called Tech Support and talked to a gentleman whose accent was so heavy that I could not understand half of what he was telling me. When he heard that my ISP was Comcast, he agreed to email me a link to the software I needed and instructions for how to install it, which he did.We downloaded the software patch and installed it on my work computer, which is running Windows 10, 64 bit version. Still no connection. I then tried using a cable and it STILL didn't work. My IT guy was totally confused as to why this would be happening. He wanted me to bring the printer and my computer to his house so he could look at it. At that point, I knew it just wasn't going to work with this Lexmark printer - it weighs over 35 pounds, and I am almost 70. There was just no way that was going to happen, not with my bad back. I barely was able to get it up on the work table, much less haul it over to someone's house and back again. I have never run into a printer (or any peripheral) that had a ""problem"" with certain ISPs, to the point where these kind of measures had to be taken to install a workaround, which still didn't work in the end.I wish I could remember the name of the other internet service provider that was affected, besides Comcast, because this issue needs to be FULLY disclosed BEFORE someone purchases one of these printers and has the disappointing experience of not being able to connect it, with or without additional software to ""fix"" the problem. This sounds like a Lexmark problem, not a Comcast problem - it's not like Comcast is some small regional provider. I would urge the people over at Lexmark to 1) Fix this problem so that talking to Technical Support is not necessary to get the patch, and 2) fix the problem so that it doesn't occur to begin with!I will never again purchase another Lexmark product of any kind, due to this unnecessary and unsatisfactory experience.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JG9X6GFFLLAT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,2,0,No,

Fine, the initial set-up is pretty similar to all laser printers; take off the tape, shake the cartridge, etc... Pretty standard.The problem is the set up with bluetooth. I specifically wanted a wireless printer. Had them before and we love them. I've only had from Brother, which was not available when i needed a printer. Their are no instructions, other than what appears on the tiny readout on the printer. This means I have to stand over the printer, with my reading glasses on, trying to figure out what that little panel is saying. I soldiered through, but to no avail.I telephoned tech support. Spoke with Segio. Very nice fellow, but he struggled. After nearly 10 minutes on the phone with him, Sergio offered to set up a tech support ticket. He started by asking me to spell my last name. I couldn't do anymore. I need to get on with my day.This printer has never been used. If anyone wants it for free, I am happy to give it to them. The only catch is that you have to contact me today.

It had to be directly connected to the computer as the wifi did not work. So, after all that, it printed in color. I printed maybe a couple weeks, but then the color deteriorated and then the toner ran out. So, the toner cartridges are quite expensive. Now, if it had been a user-friendly machine and had come with up-to-date instructions, we may have kept using it. That was not the case. If the toner had lasted longer and it was not a toner guzzler, we may have kept using it. That was not the case. If we had been able to get it to scan into email, we may have had use for it.

An all in one printer, fax, copy, and scan. It worked beautifully after a somewhat complicated set-up. Worked great for about a week and then it happened. The scan feature disappeared from the menu screen. Did you get that? THE SCAN FEATURE DISAPPEARED FROM THE MENU! A few on and off cycles did not return it to the menu screen. It was not in the set-up options either. It just evaporated into thin air. So I unplugged the unit for a few minutes and that did not restore the feature either. I tried that several times with different combinations of off on unplug, on unplug, and etc. Nothing worked. I gave up. went to a service store, got the document on one of my flash drives and made it happen that way. On another note, this device goes through several operations a day on its own. Don't know what its doing but it does it without fail. It is left on to receive faxes. It does this at all hours of the day and night! So, totally frustrated, I called Lexmark support. Now the real frustration sets in. Tech support is NOT in america. Don't know where it is but English is not their first or second language. I was on the phone for about two hours trying my very best to communicate this issue. After giving them the model number several times, and the serial number, tech support kept referring to a different model. I finally got it across to them the model I had and that solved nothing. I followed everything they asked me to do and nothing changed, nothing fixed. And they continued to tell me to use the touch screen which this model does not have. Repeatedly, they told me to touch a button I did not have. I had to repeat myself several times with every piece of info I needed them to have. Absolutely the worst tech support I have EVER encountered. They solved nothing. Repeatedly apologizing, about every third sentence or so. This call was made about 4pm mountain time on a weekday. So, I tried again a few days later in the morning hoping to get someone familiar with the English language. Same results. Now a funny thing happens once in awhile. The scan feature will return all on its own from time to time for awhile. I was so excited to see it on the menu that I scanned something just to see if I was really awake or if this was a dream. It worked every time I saw it on the menu screen. That has now ended and it just won't appear on the menu any more. Of course I went on the net to search for a fix and this is a well known issue, this disappearance of the scan feature. On another note. I DID purchase a 3 year Asurion protection plan. Filed a claim, went thru the process to get some help. After several days I think it was, might have been longer, I got an email saying that a tech was going to be sent out to service my unit and that one would be calling to set up an appointment for service. No one called. after several weeks, I got another email stating that I needed to ship the unit to Asurion and that shipping materials were on the way and that I was to pack it up and send it in. The shipping materials arrived, a label. Just a label and a repair information form. The repair information form is for a video game console, not a printer or an electronic device, or anything else. A video game console. This printer is about 15 times bigger than a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE! maybe bigger than that. What happened to the service tech that was going to be sent out. I just want it fixed! I love it but I need the scan feature. So I looked up the newer and next step better unit on amazon and low and behold it was available and at just a bit more money. I had to read the reviews and guess what. It has the very same issue! Lots of complaints about the scan feature disappearing on that newer model as well. I'm tired of typing this. I made every effort to get this thing to work myself, tech support, a protection plan, and now faces with returning/shipping a very big box if I can even find one. I could take it to UPS and see if they would box it up for shipping. That would be on my dime I believe even if they would box up something this big and awkward. Guessing $30 to $40 to get that done if they would do it. All of you, save yourself a lot of grief and don't buy this Lexmark model MC2425 or any models near it. Make absolutely sure their are no complaints on this scan issue. You have been warned. I am going to try once again to get intouch with Lexmark and see if there is a fix for this issue. I have a feeling that I will never be able to speak with Lexmark, but some person that knows absolutely nothing about this issue or anything about a fix. I would accept a new unit without this issue if they would send one out and I would return this beater I have on the printer support rack.

I print from any of my PCs without any issues (all Windows 10). Also scanning to network works fine. You do need to make sure the printer has permissions to scan to that folder (you can set users account on the printer). One feature I use a lot, you can create shortcuts on the small display. For example, I have a shortcut that scans to network, another one that scans to email. this makes scanning receipts or mail super quick. My printer is attach to the network using the NIC card. I also disabled hibernation, and set the device to go to sleep after 15 mins, but the NIC card stays awake ready to print again (you can change this settings too).

One was a toner printer and the other an inkjet. In comparison, this laser printer is much faster and prints a higher quality image. Also, the color quality is far more consistent than with my ink jet. Its size is similar to the other two but this is far heavier. My postal service carrier had to get my husband to carry it for her. It is also much noiser than the other two, by a lot! Setup took me about 30 minutes. It was not plug-n-play by any means. I am not computer savvy so this may be easier for other people. My network found the printer immediately however, it said the driver was not working. My computer showed the correct driver was installed but would not connect the two. I tried downloading the driver from Lexmark's website but could not find one comparable with windows 10. Eventually, I used the set up disk included with the printer and it worked. Inconvinent if, like me, your computer does not have a disc drive.For my phone, I had to download the lexmark app for it connect to the printer. I'm not sure if there is a way to use it from my android without the app; this was simply the easiest way I could find to get it up and running. It does require the print jobs to pass over other networks on the way to the printer. Not the most effective or secure way to print.Update: the printer is constantly coming offline. I called customer support about the issue. Explaining that I was trying to print from my smartphone, customer support said they needed access to my laptop to diagnose the problem. After screen sharing, he opened the admin log reports for my entire computer and said the issue was with the error reports I had not addressed. Mind you, these reports were for my computer, not the printer and included things like a crash report for my office software. Customer support then said the only way to fix the printer was for me to pay one of their techs to fix the log report on my computer. What?! What is customer support for if they don't trouble shoot AND help fix the issue? The gentleman was rude in his reply and told me if I didn't want to pay that was my decision. Then he hung up.

This replacement printer is FASTER, SMALLER, and QUIETER than what it's replacing-- which was an HP CP2025.It was very well boxed for shipping, unpacked easily, was not damaged in shipping and nothing had moved around.Unpacking is easy. It slid out easily and the protective materials over the toners was easier to remove than most printers. The tape was minimal and I was on my way in no time.Setup was a breeze. It asks several questions when you turn it on to set date, time, location and to clarify whether you want to set it up with a mobile phone app or not. Easy.Windows recognized it easily as did my iPhone (AirPrint compatible!) and I didn't need to break into the book included, nor the CD that came with the driver. It couldn't have been more painless to unbox and install.Using it is also a breeze. It's much quieter than my former HP when idling, goes to sleep and wakes up faster and does the job without any paper jamming nor complaints.The only part that has taken a tiny bit of getting used to has been the single paper tray. part used for things like labels or envelopes. It works very well. It prints on thicker media very fast compared to my HP, but I do miss a bit of a wing to prop up heavier, floppier or thicker singles of paper. They never fall out and the printer seems to grip on them right way, so there is no deficiency here, just difference.The thing is super attractive to look at, does everything I need it to with expediency, and while it's a full 10 years more youthful than my HP, it seems to be better built.The place where I work uses Lexmark for their most challenging, difficult environments and for the most complex print jobs like GLM printing, and they hold up.

They are nearly reliable (except when they break, run out of ink, mysteriously stop responding to commands like ""PRINT""...etc.) and slow and steady. Did I mention slow?So I was pretty thrilled to installer this Lexmark Color Laser Printer. A million years ago, when laser printers first came out (and my pet dinosaur roamed the earth), I remember how clean and crisp the printing appeared on the page . Only large institutions could afford laser printers way back then. Now ordinary mortals can.Now: the printer was easy to install. There's a cool little pamphlet with pictures detailing the instructions--no words! If you can follow the pictures, you're all set. The pictures even tell you what's recyclable. Awesome. However, there's a bar-code scanner for your phone to register the printer--decided to register the printer by phone on the spur of the moment. And some of the choices were a bit fuzzy; it asked for country and there was no place to CHOOSE my country. Things like that. More about the phone app in a second.Once the printer was installed, the Lexmark was MAGICAL. It printed in seconds flat. It took three seconds to print a full color print--crisp, beautiful. The printing for a full page was clean, no bleeding from the edges, and all the words were black and fine. The speed was astounding.However, the android app was really needs improvement. Some people do tons of printing from their phones nowadays, and if you do, you may have a problem with this app. First of all, the photos didn't print in color from my phone. They all printed in black-and-white. Lovely black-and-white, but they ARE color photos. Also, I can't print document from phone (only photo, camera, web page or clipboard). It would be great to be able to print a PDF or Word doc., for example, but it does not seem possible from the phone app. Granted, I did not try to troubleshoot at all. But I would really prefer that these kinks had been worked out before putting the app out to the public, because I'd like to have these capabilities at my fingertips immediately.The printer itself is terrific. I love it--it's fast and the printing is gorgeous. However, the app needs some work.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3758P32NJSX0K?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,8,0,No,

For this unit I’m going Wi-Fi.Power on asks if you want to set up via a mobile device, which directs you to the Lexmark Mobile Assistant app on your phone (I had to go install it). Using that app, you set up via Wi-Fi direct by finding the printer in your Wi-Fi connections and connecting (temporarily) to it.It will then search for wireless networks. It quickly found my 2.4 GHz network (not my 5 GHz). Typed in my password and we were done.If you can get the app to work, trust me, you’ll be happy. The manual ‘set it up from the console’ only has left and right arrows with an OK button to advance the letter system. So typing in any kind of lengthy or difficult password will take a hot minute!Clicking the power button puts it in a kind of sleep mode and to power it off completely hold the power button down for about 5 seconds.Once the printer was fully configured, I did a power on time test. From completely turned off, a click of the power button to ‘status ready’ took 53 seconds in Wi-Fi mode. I tested when configured via network cable and exactly the same time.Next up: the PC install. I tried to find ‘just the driver’ on the cd but the Lexmark installer is pretty much going to have to run on your local system (the web site had a more current version to download). I was thankful that at the end of the install process was a separate ‘utility’ installer for a system tray application to keep you aware of print job status, ink levels and other standard tray alerts. Thank you for not forcing it on us! But, it’s there if you like that sort of thing.The first thing I printed? My notes for this review! It was fast, I didn’t time it and only a few lines.The second thing was the image of the printer on the product page. I started the stop watch once I saw the communication light stop blinking, which is when you hear the printer spin up. Semi color page took 8 seconds.Two page document with both sides printing, 15 seconds. Same doc two pages: 10 seconds. 20 page single document B&W and Color both clocked in around 50 seconds. The attached vid shows the pace of a print jobs and the method of double-sided printing.Next I printed a color seating chart of Sun Trust field. Clicking print to finish was 15 seconds. 5 seconds communications and just under 10 seconds later it was in the tray.The printer comes with toner of course and the cartridges are going to yield approximately 500 pages for each of the Color cartridges and up to 750 pages for the Black print cartridge. Each cartridge has a model number for the ‘return’ version service and new version model numbers of standard yield and high yield. As of this posting, prices are not available on the site.Overall this was an easy to set up laser printer that is perfect for a small business or home office, could service a larger set of users easily and prints a quality sheet relatively fast. It’s got beefy stats and does what they said it would do.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D3NT5A6EC7XQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,25,0,No,

This Lexmark has so far fit the bill well with it compact size, quiet operation, and fast printing capability. There are many features packed into this printer, all of which is controlled on the almost over-sensitive touch screen (perhaps my fingers are just too big). Setup was fairly straightforward for me and I didn't need any assistance. Wired and wireless connections work very well and I have had zero problems with wireless connections.Print quality is excellent for text, and so-so for images. However, if you are looking to print quality images, that is where an inkjet will still be handy. For that reason, my old inkjet will stick around strictly for printing images.Lexmark also offers an exchange program for their toner cartridges, saving the consumer about 25%. You purchase a toner cartridge from Lexmark, in exchange for your old one. However, it appears that of the time of this review, it is currently unavailable.Overall, for a home, or even office, this is an excellent printer. Even if you don't print often at all, but need the printer to work at the snap of your fingers, I would suggest this laser printer over an inkjet because unlike ink, toner won't dry out and become waste.

They are not extremely heavy printers but tend to also need to do some occasional scanning, were interested in the idea of being able to fax medical paperwork when they can't upload in an app, and liked the idea of not having to replace ink continually. So we're in business with this printer.Hardware: Very well constructed, more durably made than your average HP or Canon these days.Packing: Very well packed in materials that did not get damaged nor have issues during shipping.Unpacking: Very easy to slide out of the box, no acrobatics requiredSetup: Setup is very easy. I used the menu rather than an app or installing things on a computerAfter setup and installing the local drivers and configuring them, the printer is very responsive for printing even though its allowed to sleep most of the time. It also works well with AirPrint which is fantastic!The LCD screen is bright, color, and easy to use. The touch buttons are also very easy to use. The functionality of the scanner, toner loading, other physical functions are easy. Double side printing is very easy.This was almost a 5 star review but there were a couple software issues that got in the way and I'm sure will be resolved with software updates.1. When setting up the fax, no matter how many times I named the fax, it wouldn't save. I had to skip it and do it later by navigating the menu.2. The printer for some reason came thinking it's main paper tray was ""colored paper"" which caused every single computer I set up to cause the printer to throw an error every time they tried to print to ""plain paper"" which is the default for every printer in the world forever and always for it's main paper tray-- I'd guess this was a setup bug/error.3. I cannot for the life of me get the software and driver for Windows 10 to recognize this model of printer to display a scanning utility. I'm expecting this to be solved by a software update as well. I know this printer was listed as ""just announced"" on the web site. The driver installs fine, I can print fine, but when I open the utility for scanning it says no compatible models found. Even Windows 10 recognizes the scanning device but...So summary: The printer is fantastic, I love it, I wouldn't hesitate on buying but only if scanning over the network is absolutely essential, and I'd guess that should be solved soon.

R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,4,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,53,1,No,
RV8PVU35QF29O,"July 22, 2019",Katherine Y,5,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,"High-end printer with many features, may require on-line help with setup","The machine has all the features you could wish for in a higher-end printer. Both ethernet and wireless compatible, the technology allows you to set up the device according to your needs, even if you choose to print from your cellphone. You can scan, fax, and print. The color copies it makes are crisp and clear. At around 40 pounds, the printer can be moved if needed. It measures 13 inches high, 15 ½ inches wide, and 14 ½ inches deep, which makes it almost a square shape and capable of fitting in smaller spaces.A small control screen that is touch-enabled is located on the left front of the unit. The keypad that comes up is very touch-sensitive. I had to enter my long wireless information more than once in setting the printer up. The only negative I have encountered in using the printer is in the set-up. Instructions are clear and detailed for removing the clear tapes and plastic tabs, keeping the toner ink in place. You may need to chat online with a company representative as I did to ensure you have established connectivity to all your devices.You do have to download the printer driver which comes on a provided disc or from the given website. You will also need to enter your unique wireless information on your printer keypad if you are choosing this method. All in all, this was not a bad experience; the representative was very helpful and clear; however, the set-up process is not entirely intuitive.The printer functions beautifully. We have it connected to two laptops. I love its quiet operation and fast 24 pages per minutes printing speed.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RV8PVU35QF29O?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,6,0,No,
RTK9V316GMLB3,"July 31, 2019",Scott McElhiney,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,"Good quality, check out cost of replacement toner","This was super easy to setup, I followed the pictures in the instructions for removing all the tape strips etc... plugged it in and used the USB to my desktop. Didn't need that though as it also setup the wifi to my network via the keyboard (could have used a mobile app on my phone), with me just pushing the button on my cable router and it found it and made a secure connection in seconds. Probably the second thing I've ever had connect where I didn't have to go through punching in a long password with correct capital letters and is that a 1 or a i or an L? I printed a test page and it did it fast and very high quality. Then I took one of my photographic pieces of artwork and laid it in the scanner bed and copied it. The only dramatic difference I see between the professional print and the copy is due to using paper that is more like parchment so I have texture rather than a glossy print. I don't believe anyone would purchase this for printing artwork, but in a pinch it'll due without leaving a horribly colored print with lines.It's size is what one would expect from a modern all in one... this is substantial, but not an office printer for those collating hundreds of copies of large documents at a time. Only one drawer for paper, so changing paper type will involve removing and reloading with whatever you need.It does two sided duplex printing automatically, so you don't have to reload paper, that is a nice feature. And you can send stuff to this pretty much any way imaginable, wi-fi, usb, ethernet, including through a few apps from your Apple or Android products.It also still includes FAX capability, something I haven't tried out because I haven't had a landline in years. It can email scans to your devices which I suspect will get used a lot more than the FAX machine part, but if you are in a business that still sends or recieves faxes, just plug in and it asks for the business name and phone number to configure itself. If you run a small office, that has a land line, I know that people pay for that when they NEED to send something by fax, so a potential profit center.The only downside I see to this is the cost of supplies. If you buy the cartridges for 2500 color copies from Lexmark with their return program supplies, it's $99.99 per color cartridge and there are three of those. 3000 pages for the black cartridge and it's $96.99. Their website shows them all on backorder, so hopefully as this printer penetrates the market, the price of supplies drops and availability increases.Given the choice between brands, the only one in the modern market I do not like is the one that times out it's supplies and lacks good support... and that isn't this. I've had good luck with Lexmark products in the past and this looks like a contender, just compare cost of supplies before jumping in.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTK9V316GMLB3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,6,0,No,
R6DC67GD24J75,"July 22, 2019",Tigerlillian,5,MC3224dwe,Vine Customer,Great quality; speedy printing; small footprint,"I've been on the hunt for a color laser printer for my home business, and I couldn't be happier with the Lexmark MC3224.This unit it totally compact and fits in my workspace unobtrusively with its small footprint. I also have a higher resolution inkjet which I will keep on standby for photographic projects, but the Lexmark laser has now been assigned as my workhorse for label printing and creating crisp documents. The print quality is noticeably better when printing text only.I love that there is no extendable document tray to get in the way or to have to remember to pull out to prevent papers from dropping to the floor: printed documents are delivered neatly underneath the scanner bed.The printer initiates quickly after a job has been sent, almost instantaneously over wireless network or USB (both tested), and the printing is quick and efficient.The manual feed is easy to use and auto-selects when I tested with an envelope, with no prompt asking which feed or tray to choose from. There is also a handy icon at the manual feed next to the sliding size guide, so you'll never put your paper or envelopes in upside down or back to front.As expected, the scanner takes a little time to process at its maximum DPI of 600, but no more than the average scanner. The output is clean and good quality.The copier works well and also has a good quality output. Speed is average.The touchscreen user interface is easy to read and intuitive.This straightforward color laser printer perfectly suits my needs as I don't scan or copy handfuls of documents at a time. If you do, be sure to check out the version of this printer that has the automatic document feed (ADF) so you don't have to babysit the machine with manual input by constantly opening the scanner bed cover and switching or turning over documents. It also comes at higher cost. Otherwise, this model handles a good amount of output and is perfectly suitable for most environments if your main function is printing.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6DC67GD24J75?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,11,0,No,
R1CWRFQ3973X5V,"July 20, 2019",Loren Woirhaye,2,MC3224dwe,Vine Customer,color laser printer,"update 11/3/2019. The printer became unable to communicate with the computer and drivers had to be removed and reinstalled. This is the second time the printer has done this and I really don't use it much. I'm giving up on using it wirelessly and I'll use the cable from now on.###Easy, nearly effortless setup. I had the machine up and running in maybe 20 minutes including downloading and installing drivers and connecting to a wireless network. It was difficult to enter the wireless password accurately due to tiny ""keys"" on the touchscreen. Thankfully this is not the sort of task that needs doing very often. It includes a software CD but my current PC lacks a drive so I had to download it.No printer cable was included. The manual as such was a sheaf of loose papers with illustrations shwoing pretty much just how to take the packing tape off and a few pages of written cautions.Printing or copying proceeds quickly. Copying is no slower than a photocopier, though I haven't used one in awhile so they may have improved. Color copies come out washed out in light places and oversaturated in darker areas. Basically it doesn't handle contrast well when copying and I wasn't able to find an adjustment for that. Your color copies are going to look like copies, not like they came off a file. Black and white copies fared better.If you're looking for easy use, speed, convenience and competitive price, this could be the right printer for you. Just don't expect much of it as a color copier. I didn't test it by scanning, saving a file and printing. That would be one workaround that would allow a user to color/contrast correct scanned images before printing.The included toner cartridges are labeled as ""starter"" cartridges and presumably have less toner in them than replacements will. Lexmark has a trade-in program for recycling cartridges that will save you about $15 on each of the four. 1500 page replacement cartridges are as little as about $75 with the trade-in and as much as about $99 without, from Lexmark. The black toner model number is c3210k0 if you want to look into replacement costs.I did not test the double sided print function but assume it works.While it worked beautifully on initial wireless setup, the second time I used it to print ( I do not print often) it didn't work and I had to uninstall and reinstall the wireless software or driver. Since then it has connected every time but I think one should be aware that like any wireless peripheral it can let you down when least expected.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CWRFQ3973X5V?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,21,1,No,

R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ,"July 29, 2019",Just Plain Larry,3,MB2236adwe,Vine Customer,3 stars and I'll explain in the review WHY only 3,"===Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.===Review begins:Just a heads up since some people may miss this. Monochrome= black and white printing ONLY. This is NOT a color laser printerThis has the POTENTIAL to be a great printer but there are several things that caused me to deduct pointsPROS:1. Good print speed. I did a 50 page double sided document in less than 2 minutes.2. 3 ways to connect. Wireless, Ethernet or USB3. Good scanning speed. I scanned a 20 page document in 40 seconds. And it WILL scan to a color document, it just won't PRINT in color.4. Compact and lightweight. At 16.5"" W x 13"" D x 14"" high it will fit almost anywhere. And at 16 pounds weight, it is a breeze to carry around. If you are old school like me, and you remember the early lasers that required 2 men, a horse and a hoist to put in place, you will appreciate the lightweight of this product5. Automatic Duplex Printing. You don't have to wait for it to print the odd numbered pages, and then reload the first prints for the even numbered pages. It automatically pulls the sheet back and prints the second side6. 250 page paper tray. Not nearly as much paper loading. And it handles letter and LEGAL size easily.6. At 5% toner lay down, you get crisp clear sharp text.7. Starter cartridge included.8. Built-n Web Server so you can check on status, jobs, level of supplies etc.9. It's multi-function so you can fax, scan, copy or print.10. When it's done for the day, it takes you out to dinner. OK not really, but it does a lot of things.So with all that, why only 3 stars you ask?1. The setup guide is a pictograph, not text.2. There is no manual included in the box or on the CD. I can understand not including a 187 page manual on paper, but they could have at least included the manual in PDF format on the CD. I had to go to support.lexmark.com to get the manual.3. It has a separate imaging unit from the toner cartridge. The unit is rated for 12,000 pages. We don't usually print that much in a year, but what about folks who print 3,000 pages a month? Every 4 months you will have to replace the imaging unit.4. And now, My BIGGEST gripe about this product. TONER COST!!!!!!!! Unless you are willing to participate in their Return program, which means you buy the cartridge and only use it once you can expect to pay $275-$350 for an extra high yield cartridge (6,000 pages) and from $90-$150 for a regular cartridge (1,200 pages) . And even on the return program for a regular yield (1,200 pages) they start at $48 depending on where you shop for it.Between having to replace toner, and having an external imaging unit, I don't care that it takes you out for dinner (again, just kidding). The operating costs for this product are too high for every day usage except in a small office. I was hoping to retire my old HP 1020, but that isn't going to happen until the consumable costs come way down. This printer is a fairly new release, so it is hard to find remanufactured consumables yet.So if you can overlook the consumables cost, then this is a good printer for daily use, even if it is not economical to use. The output is clear and sharp. Scanner works great. I did not test the fax since our fax server is in another room from the printer. Fast printing. Fast scanning. Wi-Fi enabled. Mid-point price range. Ethernet ready. USB Front port for printing from a flash drive. Network capable. USB Ready as well. Color control panel that's large enough to work with. Compact design and weight.But I am still only giving it 3 stars for the consumables cost.End of Review===Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

USB or Ethernet connectivity is also available.

R1IMHTZMA01DA1,"July 21, 2019",Mark Y,4,MB2236adwe,Vine Customer,Feature packed multi-purpose machine,"This Lexmark is a powerhouse for any small or home office. I've set it up in home home office where I am constantly printing and faxing documents throughout the day. The machine was pretty simple to get setup on my WiFi network using the Lexmark Mobile setup app available on apple and android. I suggest using the app as it's much easier than typing on the small touchscreen.The touchscreen responds quickly and is visually appealing. It can be customized with most frequently used features such as scan, fax and email. PC drivers and software was easy to install and had no issues setting up on my 2 laptops and my desktop. I can seamlessly print from all of my devices and applications.Faxing is a breeze using the top loading self feeder tray. Once the fax task is complete the machine prints out a fax log which includes your cover page (or whatever your first page was) along with the status, time, page count and number sent to.Scanning can be done from the auto feeder tray or the flat panel (I prefer the auto feeder). Print quality is outstanding, crisp clear printing every time and super fast. I formerly used an ink-jet all in one and printing took forever. The only downside I've noticed is with scanning files to a PC or mobile device. My previous machine I could put my documents into the feeder, sit at my desk and just scan to my computer or mobile device. After scanning I could tweak if needed, send as email etc.With this Lexmark when you scan from a PC or mobile device it makes you ""approve"" the job on the printer itself which to me defeats the purpose of scanning from my PC if I have to go back to the printer to OK the scan. Something I hope a software or firmware patch can fix.Overall This multi-function laser printer is a great investment and makes daily tasks much faster without reducing quality.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IMHTZMA01DA1?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,0,0,No,

R1CFP7Y6DEZ204,"August 25, 2019",Keogh,5,MB2236adwe,Vine Customer,Excellent printer,"The Lexmark MB2236adwe is a very good printer with a few blips that aren't excessively detrimental. I use it regularly everyday with complete satisfaction.Packaging is quite good with a foam shell encasing the printer, all movable components are thoroughly secured with tape and the entire bundle covered in a plastic bag. The included instruction booklet is a little minimalist and it does not come with a printer cable. Most annoying is actually the included software CD, I haven't used discs in over a decade and all my rigs are custom built so the disc is useless and the online support site is not friendly for support. The adwe version of the MB2236 is not actively supported at this time and checking the other versions only provided a driver for 1 of them, no software at all. I noticed the CD said G4 lexmark software and a quick search found me a downloadable version that works perfectly but for some reason it's not on the MB2236 support pages.Setup is a little rough depending on your networking capabilities. I hoped for a more user friendly setup. I've been building my own computers for 20 years and while networking is not my strong point I'm not a complete novice. The flexibility with this unit means there's tons of options to deal with and the unit didn't come plug n' play, it had to have the network setup to connect wirelessly and I found the G4 software was necessary for regular, continuous use. Just the driver installed allowed me to print initially but afterwards, say after restarting, the printer wouldn't auto connect or even register as online/available. With the G4 software I can print whenever without issue.Print quality is excellent, the printer is quite capable and does 2 sided printing with ease even from the copy function. Copy quality is good and overall speed is pretty good. I set the unit to wake, print, go back to sleep and it does so flawlessly. I have noticed the noise it makes while printing is a little clunky, while the printer performs admirably and professionally, that noise makes it sound a bit on the cheap and flimsy side though nothing else about it instills those feelings.Lastly, the ink cartridges are on the expensive side. I have bought many toner cartridges for most of the major brands and this one is about twice the cost of the equivalent version of the brand I use at work. Overall, once you get past the setup hurdles it's a great printer that does a lot of stuff and does them well. I am a long time fan of Lexmark, having never had problems with them and appreciating the quality. I am not disappointed with this unit at all, I wish the ink was more in-line cost wise with other brands but it's a solid product that I'm glad I ordered.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CFP7Y6DEZ204?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,8,0,No,

R4KQUR0SC0NNZ,"August 12, 2019",Beth A,5,MC3224dwe,Vine Customer,"Extremely easy to use, great print quality!  No print driver needed for Macs or Chromebooks","Before unboxing this, I tried several times to find a print driver for the Mac (since every other printer we've had has needed a print driver, and although the printer comes with a CD, my MacBook Pro, running the latest version of Mojave, doesn't have a disc drive), but had no luck, although the description indicates that this printer works with Mac systems, in addition to Windows and Linux, for which there were print drivers on the Lexmark site. I finally called Lexmark customer service, and was told I didn't need a print driver with a Mac or iPhone, that I could just use AirPrint, a utility I didn't know I had. The printer has worked seamlessly from two laptops and an iPhone. For reasons I didn't understand, though, I wasn't initially able to print from my first iPad on iOS v13.1.1, but after an update, I found the setting on the iPad, and was able to print without any difficulties.So, we unboxed it and got it all set up, and it works even more seamlessly than that. My husband, who printed from it before I did, and is using an older Mac system, High Sierra, was given the option to use AirPrint, and was able to print without any difficulties after giving the printer the network password. I just used Command-P, the standard Apple print command, got a print window, deselected the old printer, was given the option to use this printer (even though I'd never printed on it from this computer), and got a beautiful, double-sided printout with colour illustrations. The print quality is excellent, better than any from our previous printer, including the last, an inkjet which forgets it ever knew our network much more often than not. Printing from our ancient Chromebook, even for the first time, was just as easy. We've had no issues with the printer forgetting our network, so I'm sure it was the previous printer, not the network. All of the printouts have been perfect. Digital scanning has also worked very well, as does copying.This comes with starter toner cartridges which are intended to be recycled through Lexmark. I have no idea yet how long they last.This is a truthful and conscientious review, not influenced by my having received the product free in exchange for giving an honest review.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4KQUR0SC0NNZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,6,0,No,

R27BD0DH78KO5F,"August 3, 2019",AvidReader,5,MC3224dwe,Vine Customer,Great quality network printer for a small business,"First I need to state that the install was so easy that I assumed I screwed it up. Just download the app, follow the 2 instructions, and you're done. Yup... that easy. I spent 3 hours trying to figure out what I needed to do next in order to set it up and the answer was: nothing. It's literally the best setup for a network printer I've ever seen.I've been using a Dell color laser for several years and it was time to upgrade. It was still a good printer, but with the increase in print quality that is now available, and reduction in size, it was time to upgrade. This Lexmark printer wasn't just an incremental upgrade, it was a giant step forward for print quality. I'm able to print photo quality prints on plain paper. (If I was doing a finished product I'd still use laser photo paper)It's fast, quiet, and works seamlessly with all of my computer, and mobile, applications.One thing to note that frustrated me a bit was the scanner. Now follow with me on this before you judge. I've tried multiple times to scan remotely from my PC and it simply won't work while the machine is in sleep mode. It's like the network won't recognize the scan function while it sleeps. Then, I thought about it for a second. Why would I scan something if I wasn't standing by the printer putting whatever I want to scan on the machine? So unless I missing something, it really isn't a big deal.I also can't seem to scan multiple pages into one document as the model I purchased doesn't have the sheet feeder. The windows scanner app doesn't allow it, which is a pain in the neck and not Lexmark's fault. Happily, the mobile app that Lexmark provides does allow for this functionality, so there is an easy workaround.I do wish I would have gotten the sheet feeder though, so if you scan multiple page documents, don't be silly like me and say, ""I don't need the sheet feeder,"" because you probably will.All in all, wonderful printer that I would highly recommend. 5-stars!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27BD0DH78KO5F?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,9,1,No,

It definitely doesn't have the flimsy, plastic-y feel some other printers have. However, it's also not as bulky as other business-level multifunction printers. Setup was ridiculously easy, according to the picture-only quick start guide: remove the shipping tape from it, plug it in, and turn it on. There is a mobile app you can use to configure your printer (Lexmark Mobile Assistant), but it's not really necessary.The touch screen is clear and responsive, and even with my fat fingers, I'm able to use it easily. The scanner is fast, able to scan and print a color page in less than 30 seconds from warm-up to page in hand. When it comes to printing, this thing is a machine gun. I printed a 10 page doc in less than 30 seconds, and while saying it is one thing, watching it print is something else. The prints are crisp and clear, with no toner smudging or dust anywhere.Someone else mentioned there's no USB cable included (the only cable in the box is the power supply), so be aware of that.

Helpful setup process.,"General: This product replaced a Brother multifunction printer. We also have a smaller ""single function"" Brother and also a Canon laser printer for comparison.This generation of printers is faster, easier to set up and more flexible than earlier generations (any make).Size matters. Printers are used less often these days for most people, so having a smaller footprint is important.Apart from price, you may wish to consider whether you need a color laser printer, which gives you a nicer appearance for presentation handouts, but will require more and specialized consumables.PRO- Small footprint- Supports hardwired ethernet as well as wireless, USB- Well-placed network security- Color LCD to well thought-out cues to aid with setup (see photo).- Fast . Appears to meet or exceed promised print rate at single side.- Unclear whether this printer is field upgradeable.- Not measured, but this printer seemed to be a little more stingy with power during printing that our two Brother printers (which are >7 years old).- At least as good or better than our Canon laser printer (which jams now and then and can be difficult to clear)CON- Appears to be only 2.4 WiFi networks- Minor difficulty reseating the print cartridge during initial installation. There is an interlock that prevents you from proceeding.- Unclear how the field upgrades work if made available.- A lot of setup software is needed. For Windows 7 (obsolete), for instance, it could not find a suitable driver online. A completely web-based installer vs. the supplied CD might have been easier. That said, it worked OK, though it puts more running tasks into your system (tray, notifications, etc.).- In testing, noticed that after it had put itself to sleep, the printer would power itself up and go through a warming or self-test procedure (but not print anything.) May have been a one-off glitch.- The paper Quick Start Guide was not as helpful as the onboard setup tips.- Unclear if it's EnergyStar 3.0 (final version, February 2020)TIPS and REMARKSTo ease setting up WiFi, use the optional Lexmark app to assist in setting up the WiFi connection. The app will take over your network connection briefly for this purpose -- similar to what Alexa or Google Home devices do during setup.The Lexmark device allows you to skip setting up its admin password. Because this occurs so early in the setup, it's not clear what it's for. Once you have it working, be sure to go back and set it up; otherwise, it's a risk to your network.Recommend contacting Lexmark RE field upgrade options before purchasing. Online documentation was not available at the time of this review.This generation of printers is faster, easier to set up and more flexible than earlier generations (any make).How well does the printer handle jams using 100% recycled paper?

When I removed the paper tray, a large piece came loose from underneath and fell off. It took several minutes to figure out how to reinstall that.Once I was sure all the tape was removed and got some paper loaded, I decided to try and go through the setup menu on the touch screen. It took about half a dozen attempts to navigate it correctly. It said something about using an app to set it up and I tried but was not successful. It wasn’t until I did a manual setup that I got it to work. Then the app (which I had installed on my phone) was able to find it.I used my phone to print several test pages (including a couple of images) and it printed them quickly. They were the high quality that you would expect from a laser printer.Lexmark is a reputable brand and I would expect this to be a printer that will last a long time. I would also expect good customer service (I was tempted to call during setup).I think we will be satisfied with it. I'm giving it only four stars due to the difficulty with the setup.UPDATE 04/02/2020:We have stopped using this printer. It began jamming during every print job. Repeat every print job. The worst part is that there really isn't any jammed paper. It is always a sheet that didn't eject properly, but I have to take the printer apart looking for the jam in order to clear the error code. This includes removing the paper tray which always causes a piece to fall out. To put it back together I have to turn the printer on its side. I have to do this every single time. It has been at least 10 days since I got a print job without a paper jam. I'm convinced the problem centers around the part that keeps falling out. But since there was no user guide or manual and I can't find this printer on Lexmark's website, I have no idea how to fix the problem.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DRQBEFVWVPBQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,8,1,No,

A software CD is included, but it wasn't needed for setup. Once we had it connected to our WiFi network, our Mac iOS and Linux computers recognized and operated it as a printer right away. The Mac recognized the scan function too.Speaking of scanning, this machine does both sheet fed scanning and flatbed scanning/copying/faxing. All functions are operable directly from the touch screen control panel (which is simple and intuitive) as well as from your computer.There are several connectivity options, including corded via USB or Ethernet cable, or WiFi wireless. The most secure means to print documents is via corded connection, but Lexmark includes ""full spectrum security"" as an option.I didn't put a timer on it to see if it really prints 42 pages per minute, but it is fast, and the print quality is of course laser printer sharp. And it does two-sided printing.There's a lot to like here. The only minor negative is that it is a monochrome printer (black toner only) and not full color. But I owned a color laser printer for years and was never too impressed with its color output or reproduction. I think ink jet printers are better at that. Laser printers excel at super sharp and cost effective black and white printing, and laser printed pages are water resistant---they don't smear and spread if a bit of water drops on them like ink jet ink tends to do.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19VCBQED4CYJ0?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,5,0,No,

It only includes a one page (two-sided) series of illustrations showing you were to remove all of the packing material.2. I went to the Lexmark website to find set-up instructions (driver is supplied as a CD-ROM, but none of my computers have a CD-ROM drive so I needed to download the drivers). Searching on their website for information yields no results for this model.3. Fumbling through the on-screen set-up, selecting to run initial set-up just returns you to the main menu. It doesn't do anything.4. The ""troubleshooting"" selection only has two choices. print test pages and cleaning the scanner5. Even a Google search for help turns up no results. Its like this printer doesn't even exist and is a figment of my imagination.6. Purchased a printer cable to connect directly to the computer. Finally found the correct driver on the Lexmark site and downloaded it (it isn't labeled for this specific model I ended up just selecting what appeared to be the newest driver available). Was finally able to print directly connected. Wi-Fi still won't set up, even though my Wi-Fi network was able to find the printer and connect it. Neither my laptop or my desktop can ""find"" the printer to connect via wi-fi.7. Keep getting an ""E-mail SMTP server not set up"" error message each time I print. When to the Embedded Web Server site and cannot see any way to get rid of the error. Cannot ""log in"" to the web server site because I do not have a log in set up. Google search returns results for how to get rid of the error, but you can't follow those directions without logging in, which I can't do.The print QUALITY, when it does print, is fine. It is possible I just got a bad unit and my problems are not indicative of the model overall. But the lack of easily discernable instructions ANYWHERE for this model, and the fact that no site returns results for this model when looking for things like toner is a problem.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3F4VUUPLQOC2Q?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,2,1,No,

Then in step 13 there is a picture of the CD and an arrow to a laptop. My laptop doesn’t have a CD drive. So I tried using it on a desktop Windows 10 PC and it couldn’t find the printer. I assume there was a missing step somewhere that was to allow the printer to access my local WiFi network. Since I have a wired ethernet as well as WiFi, I chose to make a wired connection so that I could go to the next step in the setup program. It did find the printer and that allowed me to go further. I did have to do a bit of troubleshooting to actually get it to print. I got some error message about something (SMTP?) not being set up. I kept trying to print and I thought it still wasn’t working until I went to the room where the printer was located and found that it had been printing and double sided at that. I seem to remember it asking me at some point if I used the wireless app to set up the printer. Since I didn’t have a wireless app that I was aware of, I said no. Notice in the lower right corner of the instructions there is an I with arrow pointing to a WWW for I assume information. Does this mean, if you need help search the web? A web might be helpful.

R2IL5WOCYEQBP6,"April 19, 2020",Hyytekk,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Why do printer manufacturers assume everyone employs an IT department?,"Printers are supposed to be patient servants who sit idle, but snap to attention when you need them. They do seem too if you have a wired connection. Adding Wifi seems to reduce the printer's IQ by half. Unless you have your own IT department or a 12 year old close by to rescue you. Now that that's out of the way, here are my impressions of this Lexmark B3340 so far. I was looking for a replacement for my Cannon, that was most of all intuitive and whose Wifi just plain worked every time. Unboxing seemed promising but suspect since documentation included one sheet of printed media and a DVD. The single sheet of ""instructions"" contained no words, just a few cave wall drawings with a helpful bent page indicator in the lower right hand corner indicating the need to turn the page over to continue. Good thing, I never would have noticed it was printed on both sides! Step 12 indicates you need to turn the printer on. The final step indicates you insert the DVD into your laptop. If only laptops still had DVD readers. In my Apple world those are barely even remembered. So there we both sat in awkward silence.There is a tiny, single line display so I decided to break the ice and start pushing the few buttons there. It asked if I wanted to set it up using an app. Yes please. I downloaded the only Lexmark app I could find onto my phone, but that proved to be a dead end. I used my iMac to try to locate drivers for the B3340 and finally wading through microscopic online print and charts seemed to find what I needed so clicked the hyperlink for Mac. Nothing downloaded. I connected the printer to my desktop to see if that might make a love connection. I thankfully had the correct cable. Would have been nice if Lexmark had included one but maybe no one does that any more. Though others seem to make even a tiny effort to give you a modicum of direction. I opened my Printer preference tab, and by golly, it had recognized the new printer. Clicking on some options seemed promising but still no directions. I went back to that single line display and started clicking through and eventually found an option to connect to Wifi. It found my network thankfully and asked for my password. I hoped there might be a more handy input method. But no, you need to go through small a, capital A, small b capital B, etc. for each part of your password. Mine dutifully is 10 characters long so it was a lot of tapping. Eventually all was set up, and I directed the computer to print a page and selected the Lexmark. Thankfully it instantly printed the page, though the quality seemed a little light and non-crisp. Imagining there were internal adjustments I went back to single line display, but nothing there. In the mean time the printer went into sleep mode. I opened the Printer choices but nothing helpful there. After pushing the back arrow on the printer it said it was ""ready"" and fully awake. Thats when, in the Printer section under the ""general"" tab, there was a tiny box that said it would take you to the printer web site. I bit, and although it's not obvious at all, there are nests of settings that will adjust your printer, including print quality and darkness level. I made the adjustments, printed another page and the page was beautiful. I was interrupted but returned to make sure all was in order, tried to print another page but nothing. It said it couldn't find the printer. Ten minutes later, the page printed.Over all, this seems to be a solid relatively compact printer. It says it's made out of steel though the exterior seems like hard plastic. The single line of display gives basic information only after lots of clicking and little intuitive guidance. Once all is set up to the settings of your choice, it seems promising. I cancelled sleep mode but it still seems to doze off and not print wirelessly on command. I'll keep tinkering. In conclusion, unit build seems solid, compact and unencumbered by buttons and blinking lights. Five stars there. As for helpful setup directions or any guidance I would give it zero stars if possible. I believe this will prove to be a solid, reliable printer. As long as I don't need to wake it up by physically pushing a button on the controls, and the wifi proves reliable, I should be happy. If you're reading Lexmark, can't you simply include a second piece of printed instructions that gives a buyer even a scrap of guidance? At least for customers who exist in the Apple universe, or with Windows laptops that lack DVD access?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IL5WOCYEQBP6?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,13,1,No,

No scanner, fax, or copier. But as a printer it is excellent. Print speeds are fast at just about 1.5 seconds per page and the built-in duplexer is great. The instructions are just pictures, which can be a bit confusing, but once you have the printer out of the box they make more sense. This only comes with a power cable so if you're going to connect directly to a computer you will need a printer cable (that funky cable with a squarish connector). Because of all our devices we went with the wireless option for connectivity. The 2-line monochrome screen is used to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Again, no instructions. If you've set up a printer before this is not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that your network has to be 2G and not 5G. It does come with a CD but I prefer to download the latest from the manufacturer's website. This is a 100MB download for the full package.

R3QASHFMI7T7GV,"November 27, 2018",Tom Steele,2,B2338dw,Vine Customer,Disposable,"I didn't do my research before ordering this printer. In this day and age, I didn't really think that I would have to because usually you can find aftermarket toner cartridges on the cheap, but I'm having trouble finding toner cartridges for the Lexmark B2338adw Monochrome Laser Printer other than the $87 Lexmark return cartridge here on Amazon.If you do the math, that means that the printer is worth about $20 and the toner is worth $90! To be fair, the starter toner is a specially loaded toner cartridge with far less toner than the regular one, so it could be argued that the printer is $50 - maybe. But if you think about it, you could easily make a case for just ordering a new printer every time the toner runs out, rather than using the same printer and ordering new toner each time.I feel like this is deceiving. It would be far more honest to sell the printer with a REAL CARTRIDGE that is loaded full and charge the full price - that way you would know what it was going to cost you in real world dollars and perhaps more importantly, you could comparison shop and see what it actually costs compared to other printers. The REAL price of this printer is the price of the printer PLUS a toner cartridge which is closer to $200 than $100.Otherwise, this looks like a decent laser printer that will handle heavy printing loads and is easy to set up with Windows or Mac. But I am so put off by the marketing and price of the cartridges that I don't know if I trust the company with my business.Before you school me on the fact that all printer companies do this, I am aware that it is a common practice - but I have never seen it quite so blatant or so costly. Usually you can bypass the printer company's overpriced toner or ink and save money. But for whatever reason, there appear to be no choices except Lexmark's expensive toner. I'd shop around and find a printer that isn't going to cost quite so much in consumables as time goes on.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QASHFMI7T7GV?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,6,1,No,

Laser printers print very differently from ink jet printers. It uses powdered toner which is attracts to the paper via an electric charge. A fuser permanently fuses the toner to the paper. Hence, there are no print heads or liquid ink. This process makes a laser printer and attractive choice for people who do not print large amounts or frequently as there are no print heads to get clogged or ink to dry up.Although there are color laser printers, this is a monochrome printer so only one toner cartridge, which is easy to install and replace and all of the toner is available for use as laser printers don't need priming, as ink jet printers do. Laser printers also produce incredibly crisp prints.One thing to note is that the toner cartridge for this printer is currently ~$90. Before you gasp, realize that the toner cartridge is rated for about 3,000 pages. There is a greater initial outlay for a laser printer toner cartridge but you don't generally replace them as often as ink jet cartridges. This printer comes with a starter toner cartridge installed, which is rated for about 1,500 pages.You can use this printer directly connected to your computer via a USB printer cable (NOT included), over your wifi network or as a wired network printer via an ethernet cable (NOT included.) Lexmark has a free app called the Lexmark Mobile Assistant to help you set the printer up. I have an android phone and I downloaded the app but for some reason, it couldn't find the printer. I didn't try for long because you can actually set it up using the control panel on the printer. You just need to know the name of your wifi network and the password. The printer connected instantly to my wifi network.Next, I tried installing the software on the included CD but again, ran into some issues with the software not finding the printer. I skipped that and went into my Windows Control Panel, selected Hardware and Sound, and then selected Advanced Printer Setup. It found the printer and when I selected it, Windows automatically installed the drivers for the printer and prompted me to print a test page to ensure it was working properly. The test page printed instantly and perfectly.If you have a Chromebook, you won't be able to connect the printer to your computer via a USB printer cable. Instead, you will use Google Cloud Print, which you will need to set up. You can also print wirelessly via Apple AirPrint, Mopris Print Service and Lexmark Mobile Print so you have a lot of options for printing from your phone or tablet.This is a printer only. It doesn't scan or copy as it is not an all-in-one printer. It does, however, have auto duplexing, which is automatic, double sided printing. It has a 250 sheet paper tray and a multi-purpose feeder for envelopes and specialty papers. It prints very quickly - even double sided pages. Print quality is excellent.My only complaint is that, like many printers these days, there is no printed user manual included. You can download it from the Lexmark website, though. While you are there, note that there is a firmware update available for this printer. You'll need to download the update and follow the directions carefully to install the update. Firmware updates are important and shouldn't be ignored so take time to do this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XPSFP7O7Q5GQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,22,0,No,

There is a two page cartoon showing how to unpack it, and the only confusing thing is that there is both a toner cartridge and an imaging unit into which the toner cartridge fits. When the printer arrives, both items are installed but with packing tape and pads surrounding them and they must be removed. The cartoons are not all that helpful in figuring out what to remove, but it is fairly obvious when you have the item in your hand. Just make sure all the tape and foam padding are removed and replace the imaging unit first, and then put the toner cartridge in next.The software setup is trivial if you have an iPhone. Download the Lexmark Mobile Print app from the app store and follow the prompts. I was done in less than a minute and the printer was then available via air print on all the other mac computers and phones in the house. The WIFI on this printer is highly stable.The reason I gave this only four stars is that Lexmark charges too much for its toner cartridges. Indeed, the toner cartridge for this printer costs more than the printer! Furthermore, the printer comes with a starter toner cartridge that will only last a few months at most. So my strong recommendation is to buy the printer + toner package. It will save you about $20.That complaint noted, this is an outstanding and reliable printer.

The 2 by 1/2 inch illuminated display window stated—setup using the mobile app. At the Apple app store I installed the Lexmark Mobile Assistant.The app instructed I should go to Settings on iPhone, find printer name shown on the printer display and connect to my local WiFi network using my network passphrase. Then I returned to the app and followed the remaining steps. If not planning to connect to WiFi, connect to a wired network using the Ethernet port or connect directly with a USB cable. These cables are not included.At this point it is ready to print wirelessly. On my desktop the printer was immediately recognized by Windows 10 so I did not load the included software disc. As mentioned above to print with my smartphone I loaded the Lexmark Print app. Once the mobile app is loaded the printer appears in the Sharing option for all apps that support printing.No printed manual is included but PDFs for a Quick Start Guide along with a very detailed User Manual are available at the company website along with information about firmware updates, FAQs, etc.If security is a concern a Pin number can be established. In the configuration settings a pin number may be created that applies to all jobs or individually at print time. In either case there is no output until the user types in the pin number at the printer console. Printing can be restricted to network users and/or local accounts.Also the user can erase (sanitize) printer memory (automatically saved image) to avoid sensitive documents being reprinted without authorization. This is a complex feature detailed in the user manual. Decent features at this price point.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7VZOCQYVQ71A?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,14,0,No,

I just work at home and am a writer, so I print out stories and whatnot from time to time (along with forms, concert tickets, etc.), and this works great for my purposes.It's easy to set up, and toner is the best. I'm never going back to ink. This cartridge theoretically prints an insane number of pages, and I certainly haven't run out yet.I've always had small printers that have held less than a full ream of paper, so that's no big deal for me. I have a whole tech stand area with the printer and different chargers and whatnot, so I just keep a few reams of paper there to refill as necessary.For the price, I'd say this is a very solid toner printer.

R2AKWSB1JI8VII,"January 1, 2019",John Chancellor,5,B2442DW,Vine Customer,"Fast, Great Print Quality, Lots of Features","The Lexmark B2442DW monochrome Laser printer is a good compact printer with lots of features.The setup is remarkably easy. The instructions are basically pictures, with minimal written instructions. Once you remove all the packing material – and there is some around the print drum – then the printer actually walks you through the setup, language, date/time and time zone.You can connect wireless, via network or USB cable. I’m using this printer on a stand-alone basis, so I choose to connect via USB cable. The computer recognized the printer and it was ready to print in less than a minute – no set up or driver installation required.The printer will print double sided – but I have never had the need to use this feature, so it is not that important to me.The tray will only hold 250 sheets of paper – again, this is not a real issue for me. Most of my print jobs are less than a dozen pages and even the large jobs are less than 150 pages.All printer companies use the “Gillette Model” – price the printer very low and then make their money on the print cartridges. This model comes with a starter print cartridge which should yield about 2,500 copies. After that, you can buy the standard cartridge which will yield 3,000 copies (current price around $90) or the high yield that gives 6,000 copies (current price around $150).The print quality is great – it is laser – much better than inkjet. The speed is fantastic – up to 42 pages per minute, depending on what you are printing.If you are looking for a quality laser printer and a very reasonable price, this should deserve a good look.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2AKWSB1JI8VII?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F432573,4,0,No,
R35RLL185EVJTX,"December 20, 2018",FotoPat,3,B2442DW,Vine Customer,"Easy set up, but non-business user friendly 250 sheet tray + dumb controls to control feed trays","I have used a B&W laser printer for my daily work for about 15 years now. This is probably my fourth or fifth I've used during that time.There are five issues that are paramount: Ease of setup, ease of use, cost of use, features, and reliability/longevity of the printer.For ease of setup this Lexmark was as good or better than any other printer I've used. I had this up and running in minutes. Very easy. So far everything has seemed fairly intuitive. So five stars for setup.Ease of use was a different matter. I've had two big issues with this printer.One, the printer requires you to go into the controls to switch between the feed tray and the manual feeder. In my business I print packing lists on a full sheet and postage labels on a half sheet. The former uses the regular tray, the latter the manual tray. On all other printers I've used the printer has automatically switched between the two based on whether or not there was paper in the manual tray. If no paper was in the manual tray the printer goes to the regular tray. This printer doesn't do that. You have to switch back and forth using the controls and this is a major hassle. What were they thinking?!This printer also lacks a major feature. This model comes with a 250 sheet tray. I’m baffled and disgusted by this. Serious users buy reams of paper - a ream is 500 sheets. I see this flaw as a major detraction for anyone wanting to use this printer in a small office setting. I don’t want to have to keep filling the sheet tray. Making matters worse, it looks as if buying a 500 sheet tray costs over $100. Really not acceptable for a B&W laser printer that is clearly meant for daily use.Cost of use: I can’t really comment on this at this time other than to say the Lexmark branded toner cartridges seem to be on par with other brands. Don’t know yet about the price of off-brand toner.The one major positive in this category is the longevity of the drum/imager. Lexmark claims that it will last up to 60,000 pages which is a lot higher than the Brother laser printer I was using. Brother has a real scam going on with at least some of their current laser printers as their drums need replacing after perhaps 10,000 to 20,000 pages. Two drum replacements and you’ve basically spent the same amount as buying a new printer. Ridiculous. So if Lexmark’s claim is true this is a major positive.As for reliability, I obviously can’t really comment on that. I’ve found that modern printers are total junk in this category compared to just 10 years ago. Manufacturers are making printers to fail early. However, Lexmark’s claim of 60,000 pages for replacing the imaging unit gives me high hopes for this model. Crossing fingers.I’m giving this printer 5 stars for ease of use and the imaging unit replacement estimate. I’m giving it 2 stars for the horrible 250 sheet tray and the dumb user interface requiring the use to go into the to controls to switch between the feed trays. So 3 stars overall.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35RLL185EVJTX?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F432573,14,0,No,
R2BQMNB9XLACZ5,"December 17, 2018",David Seaman,3,B2442DW,Vine Customer,Works well hardwired. Wireless? Not so much.,"Writing this is almost as complex as connecting this printer to my network.  I followed the directions and used the printer’s menu to connect the printer to my wireless network. I was able to go through the entire setup successfully but when I completed the process the display showed it’s IP address as 0.0.0.0 “Not Connected”. The printer would not connect to my wireless network.  I went through this setup five times, slightly more frustrated but also insecure, and each time it would find my network and allow me to input the password to connect.  After an hour or so I decided to take it to my office where it’s less likely to become a nap spot for the cat and I hardwired it to my network.  From there I was able to connect. At last.               The first thing I did was to log into the Web Service and try again to set up the wireless.  I noticed that all the information I had entered from the printer was already in Network settings.  Seeing that it was all there and correct, I unplugged the network cable to connect via wireless.  No connection.  The display on the printer said “Not Connected” and the IP address was 0.0.0.0. I won’t tell you what I said.               After an appropriate amount of cursing I plugged the wire back in and logged back into the printer to go through the wireless set up again.  Even after setting the printer with a Static IP address, one that I chose myself, I was still unable to connect via wireless.  So I shut it down and went to do something else. Like kick the cat through a fan. Or set fire to Alexa.               The next morning, fortified by a night’s sleep, a shower and a cup of Sumatra coffee, I fired everything back up. I was hopeful. I felt optimism and strength. But still it wouldn’t connect via wireless.  I connected the cable and  logged back in to  double check my settings.  I only changed the IP address to the next number in line from the wired connection.  I pulled the network cable and muttered an old limerick under my breath. That did it. it was able to connect via wireless.  I’m still not sure what the issue was since the only thing different that morning was a new IP address, everything else remained the same. But I don’t question why when the good *or* bad happens.               So now that I was connected via wireless I decided to run a few tests.  My first print test was a single page and I was impressed with the speed of the print job.  It was much faster than I expected for a printer this size.  So I decided to do a 12 page document and time it.  My first attempt errored out when the printer wouldn’t wake up to the print request.  So I cancelled the job, rebooted, and tried again.  As I waited I spilled coffee on my shirt and blamed the Lexmark, whom I have since begun to call Lex, suggesting various warm places it could go if it didn’t work. This time it accepted the job. After 1:40:74 minutes my twelve page, double sided print job was done.  But I noticed that after printing a page front and back it would pause for ten to twelve seconds before kicking out the next double sided page. It repeated this behavior until all six pages were done. But they were done. It was nearly 11:00am.               Another coffee. A clean shirt. I chose to connect with the cable and time the same print job. This time is printed 4 pages and then paused for 15-20 seconds before kicking out the last 2 pages.  Still it was much faster at 54:89 seconds.  This time the pause was long enough to give me concern that the print job had crashed. I was rather pessimistic by this time. But finally out it came.               After that I thought to do another print test but this time I would use my five year old, Brother HL-2270DW laser printer to compare the speeds. I was able to print the twelve page, double sided document in 1:17:04 minutes via wireless connection with no pause between pages. I took some time away from all of it and wrote a song about Mesopotamian farmers.               Over the course of many days I have been using this Lexmark for all of my print jobs.  Yesterday alone I printed a total of 37 pages in 10 jobs.  More than once the printer would pause between pages. Oddly it wasn’t consistent; sometimes it paused after one page print; sometimes it was after two or three pages.  The first page always slides out quickly, like an ATM dispenser in a dark alley. But after an encouraging start it became a crap shoot.  The pause was not the same every time either.  On one print of just two pages the pause was close to a minute and I got up, crossed the room- this time with a rubber mallet and clenched jaw- thinking the printer had crashed. Just as I reached it it blipped, burped and resumed.               My next test was to try everything on the wired connection. Feeling more confident, even thinking I could get used to the Lexmark, I plugged the cable in, switching it over to Wire Connection with a good IP address on the printer display.  I hit “print”. Nothing. It. wouldn’t. print.  I sincerely considered eating one of my wife’s Xanax and putting out a yoga mat with “Dark Side of the Moon.” Instead I did a breathing thing I use for singing warm-ups. The Lexmark print que listed the job but it was waiting for the printer to accept it.  It never did.  I had to power the printer down and reboot it for the wired connection to work properly.  Once connected, I retried my print jobs and there was no connection issues or a pause between pages.  A 25 page print job went through quickly and cleanly. I swear there were tears in my eyes. I even rubbed the cat and sang a little Sondheim. I waited a few weeks to write this, feeling that my initial relationship with Lex (a name I stumbled onto hoping for a more congenial relationship) might cause me to pepper this review with various words that would offend or, at the very least, tarnish my reputation here on Vine. So this review is written with a staid and honest attitude. And not because I took one of my wife’s pills.               Dealing with the toner was very easy and I can see that when the time comes to replace it that will go smoothly.  Over all it seems to be well made and sturdy; nothing flimsy.  I also like the second paper feed that allows me to change paper type without emptying the drawer.  My Brother Printer does not have this feature and it would have been nice to have a few times over the years.               I suspect that there is a defect in this unit, most likely in the wireless card. That’s the only reasonable explanation for the issues I’ve had. I suggest asking questions about this issue to the manufacturer and to others who own this model. When it’s hardwired to my network I find it to be a nice printer that would work well for home or small business.  Truthfully, if I had purchased this I would return it as defective and accepted another unit to replace it.  If that one worked I would keep it and be a very satisfied customer. If it didn’t I think I’d self commit to a psychiatric hospital. With the cat.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BQMNB9XLACZ5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F432573,13,0,No,

Each method I got working first try w/o any software bloat. Very happy with setup.The physical size is pretty large…. Compared to my Canon MF4890dw.. (see pic).

R3C7RTS5KATKIJ,"December 12, 2018",Fbx_Steve,5,MC2425adw,Unverified,Full-featured color printer,"The MC2425adw is a great choice for a small office, home, or a workgroup. It feels very sturdy and well-made and has an abundance of features.This all-in-one prints at up to 25ppm, and is rated for a monthly print volume of up to 6,500 pages, so it should be up to the demands of most small offices. In testing, it reached (or at least came pretty close) to the 25ppm. I had no desire to burn through 15 or so reams of paper though, so I can't vouch for the monthly volume rating. Print quality was outstanding and it presented no problems using AirPrint from an iPhone or iPad. Setup was a breeze (with Macs, anyway; we don't have any Windows PCs), both wireless and using Ethernet. The instructions are clear and relatively concise. The Macs just found the printer and automatically installed the driver. If you have any experience setting up printers, this will be non-event. Even if you are a novice, you should be able to follow the instructions without much trouble. There might be some benefit to downloading the latest and greatest driver from the Lexmark website, but in my experience, the one Apple has worked just fine.The MC2425adw prints its first page quickly, too, usually spitting out the first page 12-14 seconds after hitting, ""print,"" not bad for a consumer-oriented color printer.While great as a home or small-office machine, it has a couple of features that make it very comelling for office use. The first is the ability to print securely. If you select this option in the print job dialog, your job won't print until you go to the printer and enter a PIN you selected when printing. This is very useful to ensure that sensivive documents don't print until you are physically at the printer waiting for them. This is a nice feature in any office, and indispensable in confidential environments such as medical and legal offices.The second is the ability to add an additional, 650-page capacity, duo input tray. From the description, this optional tray is a 550-page additonal input tray + a 100-page multi-purpose feeder. I don't have this tray, but it looks to be very useful if you regularly print from a variety of page types/sizes. The built-in tray holds 250 sheets, plus there is the usual multi-purpose feeder. The addition of an extra input tray can either give you access to an additional paper size/type, or just add extra capacity of a single size so you don't have to refill as often. Having the ability to load 800+ sheets of paper at once would be great in an office with a heavy print volume.There are a couple of things that are less than ideal, however. The first is this cryptic note in the ""Specs"" section on the Lexmark website: ""Product functions only with replacement cartridges designed for use in a specific geographical region."" This appears to mean that replacement cartridges are locked to a specific region, sort of like DVDs; I've personally never heard of this and am just speculating. That may or may not be an issue, but is something you should be aware of.The second is that, while the printer is well-suited for a moderate to heavy burden of office printing, the scanner and copier are less so if you are scanning or copying duplex documents. It scans duplex, to be sure. However, it does this by way of RADF (Reversing Automatic Document Feeder). This means that it scans one side of the page, ejects that page not quite all the way, then re-feeds it to scan the other side. Essentially, it takes twice as long to scan a 2-sided document as it does a single-sided one. The ideal scanners and copiers have true Duplex Automatic Document Feeders (DADF), with two scanning elements so that both sides of the page are scanned during a single pass. This is not an issue unless you have a heavy scanning or copying volume, AND a great percentage of that volume consists of documents printed on both sides. The ADF holds 50 pages.The all-in-one also sends and receives faxes, but I only have a VOIP landline, so I couldn't test any fax functions. This machine, like literally every other one I have ever owned or tested (which is 7 or so over the last 10 years), just doesn't work with a VOIP line for some reason.The price of this printer is quite reasonable for the quality and capabilities you get. Overall, this is a great all-in-one. I would have no hesitation making this my primary machine in either my office or home.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C7RTS5KATKIJ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07FDJQ4JR,3,0,No,
R9Z26BJY2VTUS,"December 5, 2018",Earth Spirits,5,MC2425adw,Vine Customer,Solidly Built. Good Performance.,"I received this printer in November and have been printing with it for several weeks now.I have been testing the different features of it on a MacBook Pro and iPhone X.I have always considered Lexmark to manufacture professional printers since I saw a lot of them being used in graphic design offices. My friends who worked there always praised them.I appreciate the opportunity to review this Color Laser on one end, yet I now know that I am a new toner cartridge customer from now on out if I continue to use it.This MC2425adw arrived in a large cardboard box with nylon straps around it and plenty of internal packaging. It was very well packaged. It is a heavy printer with the package weighing in at around 67 lbs. It had to be well packaged. My first thought upon seeing the box on my doorstep was how big and heavy duty the box was.I'm running MacOS 10.14.1 which has the drivers for this Lexmark already installed. It is still a good idea to go to Lexmark's website to check for firmware or driver updates. It is also a good time to register the printer if you want to do that. The latest update is a ""combined print scan fax driver for 10.6.8 and later MacOS"". It was released on 6-15-2018.Lexmark is a little behind on their pull down menu system for driver selection as 10.13 was the latest choice in the menu. They need to get 10.14 listed. Anyways, this driver works.I found the scanner works best with the Apple ""Preview"" app. You can choose the MC2325 as your source to scan from the flatbed or feeder. Scans turn out nice. The warmup and processing speeds are fast.The fax function works fine if you have a traditional landline phone. VOIP may or may not work very well. I have found it to be problematic with other fax machines and multifunction printers as well. It is the sending that can be problematic. It receives faxes just fine over VOIP.Copy functions are fine. You can copy in color or B&W. Letter size.Now to the laser printing. The first thing I noticed is how quickly it warms up and begins the printing job. It is faster than older color lasers that I have used. It isn't any louder than the Canon we have in our office right now. It is average in noise level. Not any louder to me. The print quality is very good. Lexmark toner produces vibrant colors and a broad range of color too. The 2400 x 600 dpi produces crisp text and sharp graphics. I think it has a terrific resolution. It outputs around 25ppm and has duplex printing. The starter color toner cartridges that come with the printer are said to print about 750 pages and the starter B&W around 1,400 pages..You get in the box:-the printer-starter toner cartridges-Lexmark Cartridge Collection Program information sheet- warranty card-setup guilde- a power cord- CD software and electronic owners manualIt supports media sizes:A6, Oficio, 7 3/4 Envelope, 9 Envelope, JIS-B5, A4, Legal, A5, Hagaki Card, Letter, B5 Envelope, C5 Envelope, Executive, Universal, DL Envelope, Folio, 10 Envelope.It has these paper handling abilities: Integrated Duplex, Single-Sheet Manual Feed, 150 Sheet capacity output bin, 250 sheet capacity input bin.It has these ports: Gigabit Ethernet (10/100/1000), Front USB 2.0, 802.11b/g/nOverall I have to say this is a very good printer. I have been getting excellent results with it printing from a MacBook Pro as well as from an iPhone. I like it a lot and think it deserves a full 5 stars.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9Z26BJY2VTUS?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07FDJQ4JR,12,0,No,
R2VXHUN6CLF8OB,"November 26, 2018",Sotto voce,5,MC2425adw,Vine Customer,Serious small group color laser,"First, it suits my needs for a task group shared printer. Keep the box and packing if your requirements include shipping off-site.Install is typical which is to say it takes about an hour to get the printer and linked computers set-up. Wireless connectivity is a snap. The full fidelity color laser output on a standard stock paper is primo for marketing and proposal quality production. 800-page drawer capacity is an instant labor cost saving.Note the size and weight to ensure or prepare your planned placement.If you are used to setting up and using this class printer with ink or laser, there won't likely be a problem for you.For gloss photo quality production, I prefer ink. Laser quality photo quality really does require the special laser gloss stock which I've not tried on this printer and likely won't ... deferring to inkjet.Bottom line:The Lexmark 2425 is the latest and greatest in small group laser printing. I love it so far. The transition to full laptop/desktop printer control has advanced and means no intermediate steps to the printer.5-star ... Better than advertised.

The Lexmark is quite a bit larger in size. The Lexmark cartridges are different than your typical HP and cost a bit more. My local toner guy says he can refill them so I'm not concerned. I can't comment on the yield as I'm still on the starter cartridges that were included. The Lexmark has all the features you come to expect in a desktop color laser these days. You can insert a USB drive and print directly from the divide without computer intervention. It's easy to set up and put into service. I like the fact that it has more actual buttons instead of a 100% touch screen like the HP. This is a robust small office printer that will handle your printing requirements at an attractive price.

I went through a variety of printer brands and models, and all of them lasted about a year before performance issues began to creep up. Then at around the two year mark they would just fail completely (mostly ugly horizontal streaks that I couldn't calibrate away). That alone was worth switching, but I also hated being constantly told to buy more ink when I had plenty (my HP would go months printing before it ""actually"" ran out), and also the monthly calibration/cleaning cycles. So far with my laser printer: zero hassle.Now for this model exactly: This printer was intimidating to set up at first, but after a few Google searches was able to finish. Once done, I was able to print, scan, and copy with no issues. Quality of printing is fantastic. So far very pleased, but will be returning to adjust score in the future if anything should crop up.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLXNKF4HGLGGK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07FDJQ4JR,6,1,No,

R34FYK4HWXY897,"December 7, 2018",Fbx_Steve,5,MB2442adwe,Unverified,Very capable office printer!,"The Lexmark MB2442adwe is a great choice for a small office or a workgroup. It is a monochrome printer, so it might not be the best choice for a home printer. However, if you are satisfied that you don't need/want to print color at home, it would make a great home machine too. It feels very sturdy and well-made.This all-in-one prints at up to 42ppm, and is rated for a monthly print volume of up to 10,000 pages, so it should be up to the demands of most small offices. In testing, it reached (or at least came pretty close) to the 42ppm. I had no desire to burn through 20 or so reams of paper though, so I can't vouch for the monthly volume rating. Print quality was outstanding and it presented no problems using AirPrint from an iPhone or iPad. Setup was a breeze (with Macs, anyway; we don't have any Windows PCs), both wireless and using Ethernet. The instructions are clear and relatively concise. The MB2442adwe prints its first page quickly, too, usually spitting out the first page 7-8 seconds after hitting, ""print.""It has a couple of features that are very helpful in an office environment. The first is the ability to print securely. If you select this option in the print job dialog, your job won't print until you go to the printer and enter a PIN you selected when printing. This is very useful to ensure that sensivive documents don't print until you are physically at the printer waiting for them. The second is the ability to add an additional, 550-page capacity, input tray. The built-in tray holds 250 sheets, plus there is the usual multi-purpose feeder (which in the MB2442adwe holds 100 pages, more than these typically can handle). The addition of an extra input tray can either give you access to an additional paper size/type, or just add extra capacity of a single size so you don't have to refill as often.There are a couple of things that are less than optimal, however. The first is this cryptic note in the ""Specs"" section on the Lexmark website: ""Product functions only with replacement cartridges designed for use in a specific geographical region."" This appears to mean that replacement cartridges are locked to a specific region, sort of like DVDs; I've personally never heard of this and am just speculating. That may or may not be an issue, but is something you should be aware of.The second is that, while the printer is well-suited for a moderate to heavy burden of office printing, the scanner and copier are not if you are scanning or copying duplex documents. It scans duplex, to be sure. However, it does this by way of RADF (Reversing Automatic Document Feeder). This means that it scans one side of the page, ejects that page not quite all the way, then re-feeds it to scan the other side. Essentially, it takes twice as long to scan a 2-sided document as it does a single-sided one. The ideal scanners and copiers have true Duplex Automatic Document Feeders (DADF), with two scanning elements so that both sides of the page are scanned during a single pass. This is not an issue unless you have a heavy scanning or copying volume, AND a great percentage of that volume consists of documents printed on both sides. The ADF holds 50 pages, more than most printers intended for home use, which is consistent with its office-focused design.The price of this printer is quite reasonable for the quality and capacity you get in the printing area, so it stands to reason money would have to be saved somewhere, and it was in the scanning/copying functions. That being said, the scanner is plenty fast, so you may very well find this to be a non-issue. However, it is something else you should be aware of.The all-in-one also sends and receives faxes, but I don't have a landline, so I couldn't test either.Overall, this is a great printer, especially for the price. I would have no hesitation to use it in my office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34FYK4HWXY897?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F22K2LS,9,0,No,

The setup wizard makes this very easy to set up using an iPhone. Our family has 4 iPhones, 5 iPads, and 2 iPod touches, AirPrint is a critical component for us. Our previous printer is the Ricoh in the second photo. It prints nice quality for cheap, but it’s miserable to use with apple devices.This Lexmark is a perfect and seamless component in our home apple ecosystem. There is one small trick, make sure your device is on the same WiFi network as the printer, otherwise no available printer will show up in your printer options. We have Fios by Frontier, and they provide a wireless router, but we have a much better Orbi home network we use. So with two different WiFi options, it can get a little confusing, because your device may auto select either network, but your printer will only use the network you chose on setup. If you have problems with AirPrint, check your WiFi settings.This Lexmark is much quieter than the outgoing Ricoh, and has a much smaller power draw. It warms up much faster, and prints much faster. Our old Ricoh would dim the lights during its 50 second warm up cycle, this Lexmark barely makes a sound, and completes warm up in well under 10 seconds. So if power draw on an overloaded circuit, or noise, are factors for you, you’ll appreciate this as much as I do.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JTVS3UYL34Z8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F22K2LS,7,0,No,

R1BNI07WOQLRRM,"July 18, 2019",frequentshopper,3,MB2442adwe,Verified Purchase,Problems After One Year - Will Be Discontinued in 2020,"I purchased the MX417DE on May 3, 2018. It worked great. I work from home as an Adjunct Professor. I am also a doctoral student. I print a lot. My in-box toner lasted for approximately 8 months. I purchased another toner in January, 2019. Last week (the week of July 8th), my printer began to print faded pages as if the toner was low. However, the diagnostics indicated that I had 80% toner remaining. I contacted Lexmark. They indicated it was a Toner problem. So, I purchased a new toner directly from Lexmark for $240.00. The toner was not the problem. So, they indicated it was the Transfer Roller. I purchased that for $25+. That was not the problem. Since my Lexmark warranty was expired, I contacted Square Trade (An Allstate Company) who held my extended warranty. They determined it was a hardware problem (after one year of having the printer). They offered me a cash-out or a replacement printer. I chose the cash out (5 to 7 business days). I contacted Lexmark to order a replacement. I was informed that if I contacted presales, I could get 30% off a new printer to help mitigate some of the cost because the cost of the printer had gone up since I purchased it. When I contacted presales, they informed me that the MX models would be discontinued next year and therefore, I could only purchase them directly from a dealer (without the 30% discount). That irritated me. They offered me a different model which was double the price of the previous printer. Plus, it was not compatible with the toner (80% full) that I already have, which means that I will lose all of that toner. They are going to refund my new toner purchase plus the transfer roller purchase. However, I will have to eat the 80% remaining toner that I will not be able to use unless I go to a dealer to have them repair the printer, possibly costing more than the value of the printer, given that the warranty is gone and the model will be discontinued next year. With the exception of one customer service person, all seven of the other Lexmark staff in orders, presales, parts, and tech support were either incompetent or rude. Dana at Lexmark was great. Allison was okay as well. Of course, she only transferred me back to Dana. Everyone else needs additional training or a new job. This was the worst week in customer service incompetence I have ever experienced. And I have experienced a lot of bad customer service. Believe me! Plus, I will be upside down $300.00 even after the refunds and discounts. Go figure! Just know that if you are thinking about purchasing any Lexmark MX models, they will soon be discontinued. Also, many of the Lexmark customer service people are either incompetent or rude. I would take a rude competent person if I had to choose. But incompetence is not something that I can tolerate (Heavy sigh)! If the MX models are experiencing hardware problems after one year, then perhaps it is better that they be discontinued. So, the replacement model that I ordered, which has not yet arrived is MB2546ADWE. Just FYI!

Finally, I discovered that I could simply use Windows Fax and Scan to do it but I still plan on calling Lexmark support to clarify the User Manual's instructions.

To connect, I could do it from the machine itself without loading software and hardwiring it to a computer to start. The machine is fast to respond and to print, and produced really nice text and pictures, including auto duplexing. I compared the test to an HP laser printer (B&W that one) and the test from the Lexmark is finer and less course. There is a manual feed slot at the bottom of the printer to use for envelopes, or other custom paper if desired. I had to play with my envelope layout, but now it is easy to print envelopes too, even from my phone, since the printer has AirPrint. .I tried printing a photo and it looked great on letter paper. Compared to one printed professionally (photo paper), it was a bit more red and less nuanced, but the Lexmark certainly did a better job than I had expected.I haven't tried scanning yet, but the copy function, both doc feeder and flat bed, produce nice copies.Note the size of the printer though.

R1TXY9ZLWLJ9YF,"June 10, 2020",James,5,B3340dw,Verified Purchase,"The Lexmark 3340dw is a fast, no frills laser printer that won't break the bank.","As I write this, we are still very much in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and I suspect that will still be the case come November. Here in The Buckeye State we have to request an absentee ballot by sending an application via USPS. Since I do not intend to go to the polls in person, I chose to replace my worthless, broken, 6 year old Canon inkjet printer so that I could print out the ballot application. The old inkjet actually stopped functioning properly a few years ago, and I had limped along during that time relying on the printers at work for all of my printing needs. However, I am now working from home for the foreseeable future and do not want to don a mask and drive into the office just to pick up a piece of paper.My only requirement: I was determined to have a laser printer. I've had a string of inkjets that all did a number of things, like make copies or scan documents. All of them were doomed to be mediocre at best at any task assigned to them, but the clincher is that they always stopped working after about 3 or 4 years. What's more, they are incredibly slow. The Canon for instance liked to spend about 2 full minutes making a bunch of noises, gears turning, beeps beeping, lights flashing, and that was before it even pulled a sheet of paper out of the tray. Once it finally started printing, it was like watching a JPEG download on dial-up. All that is to say that inkjets suck, and the old Canon has a date with my trusty metal bar a la the dreaded fax machine in the movie Office Space.This printer fit the bill for me. The bulk of my printing needs are things like the aforementioned ballot application, or airline boarding passes. For that reason, I don't really see a need for color unless you are doing graphics or photos. I also have a phone with an excellent camera. It can capably scan a document into PDF form, and I can print that PDF to my hearts content on my new laser printer. For that reason, I also saw no need to have a copier or scanner attached to my printer. This printer does the one thing I need it to do, and it does it fast. How fast, you ask? There is a span of about 1.5 seconds between hitting the print button and retrieving a completed printout from the printer. Perhaps this is average performance for a laser printer? Eh, what do I know? I mainly bought it because it had 5 star reviews and was pretty much the cheapest option.As for installation, I would recommend going to the Lexmark site first and downloading the documentation. The one page installation guide that comes in the box is clearly meant for an international audience (think IKEA), due to it being a series of slightly confusing pictographs that lacked any meaningful text instructions. If you want to print from any computer running windows 10 then you will want to go to the Lexmark site again, and download and install the driver first, presuming of course that you do not have a cd-rom drive to use the included install disk (it is 2020 after all). I tried installing without the installation software on my windows 10 desktop, and it inverted the color so that it printed a black background with white text. Obviously that will use up your toner in a hurry. My Macs on the other hand worked perfectly with AirPrint. Also, get the mobile app to set it up. The on-device interface is where I suspect they cut corners to get the price so low, and the app is faster and easier by far. Once you've done that, you can administer the printer settings via it's web server on a browser, which has no such shortcomings as the on-device interface. Last recommendation, setup security so your wannabe hacker neighbors don't decide to do it for you, and lock you out of your own printer.This printer is my first Lexmark, and it has exceeding my expectations so far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a similar use case to mine. However the jury is still out on the longevity of the device, due to a lack of a sufficient amount of time passing or an ability to divine the future, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TXY9ZLWLJ9YF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,25,0,No,

The build quality of the printer feels great without any loose or parts that seem like a slight knock will break it. It warms up much faster than other printers I have used and is pretty quiet. However I have had two problems with it, first of all from one of my windows 10 computers it prints black as white and white as black and I have tried many things to try and find a solution but I just can't and at this point I'm scared of trying any other fixes because it is just running though my ink. From my other computers both windows and Mac devices it works fine. Second the mobile set up didn't work for me so I had to connect my printer though a ethernet cable which you need to have on hand. This process is much less intuitive and if you don't know how to do it i'm sure there are tutorials online but it would have been nice if Lexmark provided some more simple instructions on how to use the printer.

RA4TT0RCQT8VK,"March 27, 2020",Robert J. Newell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast, Good Print Quality, Easy to Hook Up, But Where's the Toner?","Let's be clear, it's a good printer. It was easy to set up, has decent features, and the print quality is good.Setup: cabled setup is easy, although if you're not going to go wireless, you'll have to supply your own cable, whether USB or Ethernet. I won't dock them for that, although they could have said ""cable not supplied"" in their writeups. This just worked out of the box on my Linux system. For Windows, you should probably download drivers from the Lexmark support site. Not sure about Mac.Wireless setup is accomplished from the little display window on the printer. I've always found this annoying but if you run Windows and want to install their software you can avoid this. But there is nothing hard about it, just a little tedium, and it works as it should, although I always prefer the Ethernet option. (Tip: on your router, assign a fixed IP address to the printer. This makes life easier for non-USB connections.)Okay, how does it work? Just fine. Double sided printing is wonderful, print quality is great, speed is about what you'd expect today--- in other words, very good for a home printer used by a few people. (Don't expect to use this in a 20 person office, though.) It's a light-duty printer, very suitable for a home office.Build quality is good. Don't drop it off tall buildings, but don't be afraid to move it around or carry it around. It should stand up just fine.Now, the one gripe. Toner. It comes with the plague of printers in pretty much the last decade, the dreaded ""starter"" cartridge. This is a cartridge that is maybe 10% full, meaning you have to buy a real cartridge almost right away. And guess what, the cartridge price is in the same range as the printer price in most cases. Manufacturers don't have to make money on the printer, they make it on the cartridge.The ""starter"" is supposed to be good for 500 pages, about one ream. If that holds up, depending on your needs, you might get a week or two in a busy home office, and maybe a month or two of really casual use.So you better order that cartridge. You go to the Lexmark site and ... oh my, they aren't selling them. Maybe a little later on? Better hope so, or pretty soon you'll have a brick. This is 100% inexcusable. And comparing similar Lexmark printers, the cartridge will be over a hundred dollars. Wow.Usually there are 3rd-party cartridges, often for about 15% of the price. That's what I always buy for my other printers; I find a reputable vendor and buy from them. But you cannot get the cartridge for this printer anywhere at the time of this writing (late March 2020).I'm going to provisionally rate the printer four stars. After all, it's a very good product. I would have gone five if the cartridges were available at a fair price. I will revisit this later. If in a month or two you still can't get the cartridge, the rating will be one star.Followup in June 2020: Toner is now available from the manufacturer (pretty expensive) and from at least one third party (a little less expensive but still not cheap).",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4TT0RCQT8VK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,11,0,No,
R2E0YW6BHGAOSB,"March 23, 2020",JoeInTampa,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast print from cold start, easy to set up.  Clean print.  Needs documentation.","This is a very nice monochrome laser printer. One I had previously took a long time to print from a cold start. This one begins to print almost as quiickly as an inkjet printer. Print quality is excellent and print speed is high. Wireless setup was very quick and easy. I like Lexmark's Unison toner. It separates the toner cartridge and the imaging unit unlike other toner cartridges where the units are combined. The Unison toner cartridge doesn't need shaking to equalize printing and prints at lower temperature than previous types of toner, so that means lower energy costs as well as quicker printing from a cold start. My only issue is probably due to this being a new item that I received through the Amazon Vine program.

The printer runs pretty quiet and quick. The biggest concern you may have is replacement toner cartridges, which similar printers at Lexmark are well over $100, although I haven't seen any for sale anywhere as of yet - but since this is a new product, I'm pretty sure they will roll out when the printer goes public.

RU29785I48QOO,"March 18, 2020",LifeIsGood,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Speedy monochrome for the small or home office,"This compact laser printer (8 3/4"" H x 14"" W x 14"" D) does just one thing, but it does it very well. From sleep to first page out is under 10 seconds and pages print at the advertised speed, even using the duplexer, which I love. The picture instructions are bad, and there is nothing else, but once you get the printer out of the box they kind of make sense. This does not come with any cables other than power, so if you want to connect other than wirelessly you will need an Ethernet cable to connect to your network or a printer cable (with that squarish connector) to connect to your computer. I opted for wireless as I wanted to test this with my Android tablet as well. Once you power on the printer you have to use the 2-line monochrome screen to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that if you connect to a network it has to be 2G and not 5G. The driver for this is not on the Lexmark site as of this review, so I had to use the CD (I tried with the Windows driver and the pages printed like a negative, but the Lexmark software fixed that). The Lexmark app installed fine on my Android tablet (Samsung) and I was able to print from there as well. This is a no-frills B&W laser, but it is the best one I've ever used.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU29785I48QOO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
RX72XBHQ26O0T,"March 16, 2020",Man in the Middle,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Very fast and works well. PC setup is easy. Mac setup is manual.,"The first thing I noticed on setting up this new printer is that it came with only one page of pictorial setup info, and no manual. It did include a driver CD, but my iMac running Catalina couldn't find any files it could run on that. In addition, searching the Lexmark website found no useful information about this new B3442dw model (though I did find a brochure about its likely predecessor, the B2442dw.)Fortunately, I was easily able to set the printer up properly anyway. Just remove all the packing materials both around the toner cartridge and on the outside of the case, load some paper, and power the printer on. A built-in small display will talk you through the needed initial settings, including entering a password to join your WiFi network. From there it was simple to tell my iMac to add a printer, and chose that one from the bonjour list that appeared. Once set up, its Options & Supplies button in the driver allows all other settings to be seen and customized easily.Since I do also have a Windows 10 laptop PC (Dell Inspiron XPS 15), I WAS quickly and easily able to install a driver on that, using the included CD.Once a driver was installed, printing on both the iMac and the Dell was a simple matter of choosing the Lexmark printer for a document. The result was blazingly fast (I've never seen such quick duplex printing before), and good quality.Overall, this is an excellent printer, lacking only a bit more attention to documentation to be fully ready for prime time on Macs in addition to Windows PCs.Update: Just discovered an interesting problem. For no obvious reason, the link to this printer at IP address 192.168.1.26 has also taken over the link to my Western Digital MyCloudEx2Ultra at IP address 192.168.1.2. Attempting to open a Web page at 192.168.1.2 shows the printer's web page, the same as if I'd opened the page at 192.168.1.26. And the MyCloud can't be accessed unless the printer is powered off. Those two addresses should NOT be in conflict, but somehow are. I'll update once I figure it out.Update 2: No toner is listed as available yet for this printer, either here at Amazon or at the maker's website. Whether the toner for the earlier model B2442dw would also work on this new model is unknown. The printer comes with a starter toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX72XBHQ26O0T?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R2558N1P0X0T8S,"March 15, 2020",Eric L.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Full Featured Networkable Printer,"The printer does not seem to come with a USB cable. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one on hand or buy one. Or at least mine didn’t come with any cables other than power. That was ok for me because I am using Ethernet and I have a bunch of spare Ethernet cables, and there is also wireless connectivity available. But USB likely the easiest way to get up and running for non-techies, so if this is you, have a spare printer cable lying around, or purchase one with the printer. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one or buy one.Once unpacked and set up following the crude pictograms included, it was necessary to download the drivers and install them. The unit does come with a CD installer disk, but even if you have an antique computer with an optical drive, it makes more sense to go to the Lexmark website and download the latest drivers. Who knows how old the ones on the CD are?After plugging the printer into my switch using Ethernet, and running the installer, the software could not find the printer, nor was it listed by my router as being connected (though the Ethernet activity lights on the printer were flashing). Eventually, I noticed that the small LCD display on the top of the printer had some questions about time, date, and language that must be answered on the printer before it will even show up on the network. After completing the setup on the small LCD screen, the printer was connected but the installer still could not find it. Instructions would have been helpful here, especially for people who aren’t technically inclined, but you can probably find help online.It was necessary for me to go to my router’s web page, get the printer’s DHCP provided IP address, and plug that into the installer manually in the “advanced set up” area. Also, it asks for you to manually type in the port name. I typed in “Ethernet” (no quotes) and it worked, the installer was able to proceed. After doing this on my main computer, I went back to the router and assigned a fixed IP address to the printer so that I will have no trouble finding it when I install the driver on my laptop and other computers.The software itself is nice and compact. I have a Canon printer that came with software that’s all up in your face all the time… meaning, it came with a bunch of bloatware like scrapbooking apps and card making apps and a bunch of docks and control panels that I had to carefully remove after writing the review. In the case of this Lexmark, it’s all business and it’s not in your face at all, and I appreciate that.The printer is fast and quiet. Over Ethernet, when I send a page the printer, it’s done printing before I can even start wondering how long it will take. Coming from an inkjet printer, this is really nice. Also, the network connectivity is indispensable these days. It certainly is if you have two or more devices in your life that you’d like to print from. That network connectivity also makes it easy to tweak the settings as the printer publishes a web page that you can reach from any web browser (if connected to from your local network). Just type the IP address of the printer into your browser and the settings page comes up. By the way, this is another good reason to assign a static IP to the printer; you can then just add a bookmark to your browser. That administrative web page allows you to change many parameters in several categories. Some of the settings are beyond my paltry comprehension, but there is a lot there that is useful to me, and some of it I’m sure is useful to IT personnel deploying these things on larger networks. There are a lot of IT tweaks and settings available here.The printer is handsome looking and compact, and it feels durable and professional. I think it will be perfect for my home office. Every computer I have can now print quickly and quietly from anywhere in the house.The unit comes with a toner cartridge that is described as a “starter cartridge.” It’s not clear to me how many pages we will get out of this; also, at the time of writing this, I couldn’t find replacement cartridges on Amazon or on the Lexmark site. No doubt they will be rolling these out soon; I just hope it’s sooner than my “starter cartridge” lasts. When available, I expect the replacement cartridges to cost well north of $100 each.I remember when laser printers cost a couple thousand dollars each, and then you had to pay extra for network connectivity. The price of this one is very appealing. In fact, it seems like a steal at this price. Just don’t forget that they get you on the toner, same as inkjet makers get you on the ink. There’s still no free lunch.Other than that, I’m delighted with this little printer. It really is quite perfect for a small office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2558N1P0X0T8S?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R10V9WCIQS76AL,"March 14, 2020",Summit,1,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"FAST! Love it!  ***UPDATED: Didn't last through starter toner...  it's dead, Jim!","*********EDITED MAY 2020: It didn't make it through the tiny starter toner. It connects to the network, it just refuses to print with no indication why. I'm a retired network engineer and have dealt with the nastiest of printer problems on networks and repaired printers in the field with paperclips, soldering iron and sheer anger. This one stopped working rather early on and can only print it's own configuration- no other print jobs will work and nothing more of an error than it just ""can't print"" the job. My last Lexmark was an utter failure, too... and this one will now join it as I have to PAY to recycle them both. As of today, replacement toner is not available anywhere- even from Lexmark unless I mail in the empty one first to refill. I'm done with Lexmark after decades of buying dozens and dozens of their enterprise printers at a time.**************This is a no-frills, monochrome printer without all the fancy touch-screen nonsense. What it does, it does perfectly- spit out paper quickly.I print a LOT while I'm working on some business plans, consulting and getting my MBA just for giggles despite being retired. My color laser eats toner as if it is free and it most certainly isn't. Having a monochrome, fast, two-sided printer as a default is the best idea ever... save that color printing for when it's actually necessary. It's surprising how often one does NOT need color, and the cost savings of not wasting printing in color is significant.I set this up without looking at directions, as I always do. Initially, it didn't detect ANY WiFi networks in my house when there are actually five of them. This was odd, but after several tries it started to see them. I had to go through typing the password through the simple buttons and simple display three times, but it finally connected and all is well.There is an app for this as well as computer software, but I chose to do everything without adding yet another app or yet another bit of software on my computer. It's likely far easier to do it with the apps etc- so unless you're just a glutton for punishment like me, just use their app.When it came time to print, this is when I became a big fan... it spits paper like crazy! I set it to print a large document, four pages per side, double sided... and wow, it was racing through it so much faster than any other printer I've had. SUPER fast at getting prints done. The print quality is fantastic, too. Double-sided printing saves SO much paper and space, too.Lexmark has always been one of my favorite printer suppliers, mostly known for their commercial machines. My last Lexmark was a color laser which was a complete disaster and never worked well at all. It ended up being recycled without ever having a successful print. Lexmark has redeemed themselves with this one- it's a business class machine that will absolutely STUN you with how fast it can put out pages. The ads say 42 pages per minute... which is faster than what I got, but plausible.Bravo, Lexmark. There are cheaper printers out there, but this one delivers performance that is worth every penny.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10V9WCIQS76AL?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,2,0,No,

I finally decided to go with this one because it seems all printers get bad reviews but this one didn't seem to be too bad. I received my first one very quickly and I was very excited. I opened it and saw that the scanning bed was cracked. So, back in the box it went. Mind you, this is a heavy machine and it's not easy to pack it up, etc. I requested a new one to be sent to me.The second machine took longer to get to me but I got it in about 3 days. I got it out of the box and got it set up. I connected it to my internet and thought things would be realitively each. No such luck. You have to down load an app to your phone to be able to print from your phone. I do a LOT of printing from my phone or Ipad. So, I down load the app and it can't find the printer even though they are on the same network. After getting the manual off of HP website and doing some searching, I realize it's because one of the settings is wrong. Sorry - I can't remember the setting now and I don't have the printer any longer. So, I set the indicator and it seems my phone sees the printer. Yea! So, I go to send a document to the printer. It's about a 10 page document. My current deskjet would hardly take any time to print this type of document. I waited and waited, etc.... The printer kept saying it was receiving the document but wasn't printing. After about 30 minutes, I decided to try to set up the software on my printer. Of course, in the middle of setting up the software, the printer decided to 'start' printing my document but only printed about a quarter of one page and that is all I ever saw it print.So, I decided to try to concentrate on getting my computer set up. Again, my deskjet was never an issue. Find the printer and start printing. I updated the software and tried to print a document again from my computer. I kept getting communication errors between my computer and the printer. The printer was online the whole time and so was my computer. Mind you this went on for a few hours one night and into the next day.When I finally think something is printing, it printed a small box and then I got a firmware error. So, I went to look for an update. Again, you have to connect thru your computer to the printer using the computer number. The printer was showing me the number but everytime I tried to access it, it would time out. I tried this for a few hours. This is the only way I could find in the manual to actually update the firmware on the printer, but since I could not get to the actual menu, I couldn't update it.By this time, I'm fed up. So, I decided in the end to just return the second machine also. Please keep in mind, that I work in IT. I'm not a hardware person, but I can figure out most things if I have instructions. I don't know how they expect anyone to get this working without support. Yes, I could have called for help and it might have been resolved, but I don't like to have to call for help.

Scanning difficulties.,"This Lexmark MC3224dwe multifunction printer/scanner/copier/fax is the version without an automatic document feeder for scanning/copying/faxing.There are numerous unpacking videos online as well as a user manual you just have to make sure you have the model ""dwe"" extension some videos address the automatic document feature version of this machine.The MC3224dwe does not come with a hard copy user manual but does come with illustrated unpacking instructions and a CD with software.The setup for manual wireless operation requires input of the network password on a tiny LCD screen without echoing the actual characters input. This makes for an excruciating experience without character visibility. Mobile app may be easier to use since cell phones have better keyboards.The option to scan from the MC3224 to a pc wirelessly disappeared from the LCD menu screen so I could only scan as a pull option from my PC. I think if I purchase a USB cable then maybe I could initiate scanning from the MC3224dwe LCD panel, but I am unwilling to invest in this wired cable since I need wireless capability.I was able to wirelessly produce test prints from my iPhone to the printer and it worked flawlessly. The print was of good quality it is not on par with my older Dell color laser printer.Joining the MC3224dwe to my Windows 10 laptop was no problem and I can print from windows. No fax test was attempted because I don't have a phone line near the printer.The toner cartridges must be Lexmark new or recycled and third party cartridges will not work. These cartridges are VERY expensive even with Lexmark's recycling program. Typically, replacing all 4 toner cartridges will almost cost as much as a new printer! This is a HUGE deal breaker for me since my Dell color laser cartridges are far less expensive and my Canon MFD black toner is a fraction of this cost.If you use a wired connection, then you may have better results setting up this device. I did a lot research online trying to compensate for the wireless scanning feature, but I was unsuccessful as a result, this will be useless for me.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JNRMNTBR74AC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,0,1,No,

R291OJN6PJCTIT,"September 18, 2019",J. Peplinski,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Powerful and heavy,"I got this for home use, but it's really somewhere between a home printer and an office printer. Typically most people don't use a laser printer at home because the replacement toner is so crazy expensive, but this isn't enough printer for a huge office either. Maybe a very small business, even a home business? It definitely yields very professional results.It took me a little while to get it set up, as I don't have a disc drive (it comes with an install disc, but for some of us that's not helpful). The enclosed instructions were not very helpful, and the on-board touchscreen wanted me to set it up for mobile using my phone, then did not provide the correct QR code or series of numbers for me to get it working. Finally I did a manual driver search using my computer's install-printer settings. Even that was a little more complex than usual because it wanted me to enter the printer's IP address manually; fortunately that number WAS on the little touchscreen, and after that it was smooth sailing.After the minor hiccups of setting it up, it worked fast and extremely well! I needed to print a full-color comic book page onto cardstock right away, and it spat it out in about 10 seconds looking absolutely perfect. I understand I'll run out of toner in about a week if I make that a habit, but it is nice to have that capability when I need it! So far it has printed very crisp, professional looking documents, and the full color prints have been absolutely flawless.It is a little larger than my inkjet (which admittedly is a big, multi-function inkjet) and it is A LOT HEAVIER. So be sure you have a good printer stand for it, because it needs it's own place. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone and everyone for home use, as it is a whole lot of printer for just the occasional job. But if you need excellent quality printing and are able to pay for supplies, this is a very solid model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R291OJN6PJCTIT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,0,0,No,
R1CNBRTS6Y639V,"September 16, 2019",Dave Cunningham,2,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Mediocre office printer,"The main reasons this Lexmark doesn't get high marks from me: the setup is not as quick and easy as other printers I've had, and the color printing is only mediocre. I sometimes print photos and images on blank DVD disks, and I love that my Canon printer can do that in a very high-quality way. This Lexmark, not so much. Also, it's considerably larger than my Canon.It does spit out pages fairly quickly, about one every 3 seconds, and if you just need black and white document copies, this is a good printer for that. It's really best suited for office work.Another downside is that the toner is quite expensive. I was hoping to find a generic toner that would be compatible, but apparently none such exists yet. I know people who much prefer laser printers to inkjet, and perhaps it will last longer than my Canon inkjet printer -- I have gone through three inkjets in the last eight years -- but I still prefer the nice quality color printing of an inkjet.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CNBRTS6Y639V?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,0,0,No,

R2QGCPEHD3BGXH,"August 15, 2019",Dora Explorer,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Great printer for small business or a busy household,"I'll start by saying that we are using this printer at home.*PrintingThe printer starts up and prints very quickly, even from being fully asleep. Black and white print quality is very good. The text is very crisp and dark. Color printing is great for say printing web pages and colorful items such as that. For pictures it’s passable, but it’s not the kind of stuff you are going to print out and put into a picture frame. As long as you are printing on the front of the page only it spits the pages out very fast. If you do two sided it has to suck the page back into the printer which takes much longer. All printers that do duplex do this, so this is not specific to this printer though.We have had the printer be picky about the paper it picks up. There was one certain batch of paper (and we do not remember where it came from, sorry) that it had trouble picking up and jammed once and printed crooked on the rest. Everything else we have fed it has been fine.*ScanningThe scanning seems to be pretty good. The automatic document feeder is a very nice feature, and is something we considered essential – I’m too old to stand there and swap pages manually.Another nice thing about the scanner is that it functions on its own. Some lesser printers require software on a computer and the devices have to be connected and all that in order to scan things. This is a pain and never works well for me. With the Lexmark printer though, you can email the scan jobs and as long as you have the email server set up it requires no computer or additional setup.It’s not immediately obvious, but if you set up what the printer calls a shortcut, that’s basically the address book for the scanner. Also, this is 10x easier to set up if you go to the web page of the printer. It can be done from the front panel but typing on the keyboard is a little painful. Just go to the IP of the printer in your web browser and you can set that up much easier.*Software and DriversThere is also an app that helps you set up wireless and such for the printer. It wasn’t great but it got the job done, just follow the instructions.We have android phones and used the android print plugin. It has low ratings in the play store, but for us it worked well without any issues at all.The latest version of windows 10 found the printer but did not have a driver to print with. If you go to the Lexmark website and type in the printer name, there’s a small download that will install drivers and find the printer and everything seems to work OK.For a mac, I was a little concerned when there wasn’t any mac version of the printer driver to download at first. When I tried to add it anyway I realized that the printer speaks airprint/bonjour and the printer was immediately found and added with no drama whatsoever.*Aesthetics/Fit and finishThe printer is a decent sized one, it’s bigger than most consumer printers, but it’s not huge. It feels well built and does not feel cheap or flimsy.The screen is touch and works very well, with intuitive menus and plenty of options. When you are using the keyboard things get a little tedious, but it does work and works well enough to actually use.The paper tray holds a fair amount of paper, and a nice feature is the printer knows how much paper is in the tray and when you look at “supplies” under the printer driver or in the web page, it will give you a useful indicator of the amount of paper.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGCPEHD3BGXH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,5,1,No,

R21NOJFP9M5O7L,"August 2, 2019",Shane O. Laake,5,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Rather compact and very capable for the price,"The box that the unit shipped in was rather large, though when you remove the foam padding and consider that this is a color laser all in one with duplexing and a sheet feeder, it's rather compact. Setup starts with removing from the aforementioned foam, removing a large bag, and removing a bunch of tear away strips. Note there are pull tabs on all of the toner cartridges as well.Software setup can be completed via an app on your phone, but not if you're rocking the ethernet (which I prefer). Web download of the latest drive is a bit of a pain, as Lexmark uses the whole separate support page vs sales page strategy. The latter comes up first in any searches, but clicking support dumps you at the main support page. Boo! Once you find the software/drivers, it's also a bit of a miss, as I needed to specify my OS and 32/64 bitness, which is very 2009, and not 2019.That aside, the software installed easily, and it defaulted to not sending info back to lexmark--kudos! This thing prints crazy fast--go back to the last sentence and read this thing prints, and that's how long it took to do a full color portrait. Granted this isn't a photo printer, but it'll meet every need short of that expectation. My last home color laser was an OG four pass model, so this is such a revelation! The quality of print is also equal to the task.I don't do a lot of scanning, but it does a solid job, and the feeder is greatly appreciated (the limited scanning I do tends to be multipages documents I've signed). I haven't (and won't) use the fax. Copies are quite snappy!All in all, I love this printer. So much nicer than any inkjet! Toner doesn't bleed, and it's so fast. I haven't used this one enough to speak to reliability, but for now, assume it's spot on (I'll update if/when it isn't).Highly recommended",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21NOJFP9M5O7L?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,4,0,No,

It’s really well made, offers a ton of great features, and looks pretty good on my desk. While my needs for this printer aren’t many (I have another printer for my home office), it’s worked really well for me so far and I’d be happy to recommend it.Pros:When printing the black text shows up crisp and clear on the page, proving immediately that it’s a quality piece of equipment. It’s bold and punchy, and I haven’t had any trouble reading anything I’ve printed yet. The color printing for photos and images is pretty good, though I’ve seen much better from other printers. It’ll work just fine as long as printing color isn’t your main objective. After setup, the printer easily connects to my devices (Macbook, Android) without fail, and I’ve absolutely never had a problem.I love that the printer is so quiet - it doesn’t even wake my sleeping pets when they’re in the same room! The scanning feature is pretty easy to use and self explanatory with a regular speed. The small touchscreen is easy to use and lends a modern feel to the machine. Everything on the machine is high quality, and it feels like it’s made to last. Nothing flimsy whatsoever.Cons:As mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t recommend this printer if photos and color-use are your main objectives. While the printer works fine for these things, the vibrance is notably less than for my previous printer (Epson Workforce Pro WF-4630). This feels nitpicky, but I’d really have expected a larger paper tray from a printer of this size and price.Setup took a little longer than I’d prefer - you have to install a driver and painstakingly connect the printer to all your devices. Again, once setup, you’re good to go, but know that you’ll be sitting down for a good half hour or so to get it all working. For home use, I find the printer size a bit much. It appears to me a little smaller in the photos, so I was surprised when it arrived and I had to find a bigger spot for it.Overall, though, it’s a pretty good product.

Photos and graphics look more muted, and less crisp, that than with a photo printer, but still quite good. For office applications which do not require photo-realism, the print quality it is pretty much ideal. Print speed is also quite fast, and even duplex printing is reasonably quick.-=WIRELESS=-Wireless connectivity is fast and painless, and Windows 10 found the printer with no difficulty.-=SCANNING/COPYING=-The 600 dpi scanner on the 3224 is fairly standard, but the ADF is a simplex scanner, which is frustrating for some applications. Speed is quite good.-=CONSUMABLES=-I highly recommending setting the printer to default to black and white, and then only turning on color when you need it.

They are roughly $70 each.-=BUILD QUALITY=-This is a solid piece of hardware that feels well-made. Nothing feels cheap or flimsy, and it appears to be designed for regular, consistent use.-=OVERALL=-Performance isn't quite comparable with my favorite MFC line - The Canon ImageClass printers.

This particular model was very easy to set up to print from a variety of sources—including Airprint, Google Cloud Print, the Lexmark Apple app on an iPhone and/or iPad, and a network printer from a Windows PC. Resolution on the type or font is good, making the print quality excellent.

RGN6CJJRKWO81,"August 6, 2019",Matthew R,5,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,Color printer/photocopier.  600dpi with photo enhancement.  Wireless capable and fast.,"This is a nice compact color printer. It also allows you to scan, fax and copy. The printer can copy/scan/print in 600dpi but if you use the photo settings you can get results that look better than 600dpi. It will not produce the results you would expect from a photo printer but it can produce nice quality output if you use the right settings.The touch screen is also in color and is bright and clear. (you can see it at an angle easily as well) It is nice to scroll through the menus like you would on your smartphone. (touch and drag)The scanner seems to make images a little brighter and a more 'washed out' than the original in some cases. The software comes with a TWAIN-compliant driver that will let you import images into your favorite graphics manipulation program. (like Photoshop for example) I was able to scan photos with close to photo-quality output by selecting the Photo Mode from the menu of the TWIAN driver and changing the dpi setting to 600. The image looked better than 600dpi but it did scan in 600dpi. The full 8.5x11 sheet was 5100 x 6600 pixels. (if you divide the pixels by 600 it ends up being 8.5 x 11)For office or home use, it is a great little printer as long as you aren't expecting it to print photo quality. One nice thing about a laser printer is that it can sit of years without issues, unlike an inkjet where the ink can dry and cause issues if it is not used frequently.The printer was easy to install and comes with an actual CD/DVD. (you can find the driver on Epson's website very easily if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer) It can also be set up to print from a phone over WiFi. My experience with printing from a phone is that it is a last resort since the phone itself limits the control you have over the print output.In summary, the printer only prints in 600dpi but some kind of enhancement is going on that makes photos look better than 600dpi when it is used. Even with those settings, it does not with photo quality results. For graphics, text and even photo-like quality, it is a great all-around multifunction.The printer goes to sleep on its own after a bit so to use it wirelessly you may need to power it on. It can be used as a scanner though it can only scan at 600dpi. (photo mode enhances the image for photos) I haven't tried the fax functionality since I do not fax much. The copier functionality is slick. You can navigate through the menus to get the optimal settings.It does everything I would expect it to do. The photo enhancements from photo mode produced very nice results for 600dpi, even though the output is not photo quality.

As soon as it was set up it was obvious that the print quality was very poor. After contacting Lexmark and sending examples and details (SN, proof of purchase etc) of the printer, the initial diagnosis was a faulty toner cartridge. A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience.

Well, I have used this printer in my office and was blown by the quality of prints it does. One day when I saw a huge discount on 3224awde I just make a purchase blindly and I am glad that I have invested in right thing. Here are some of the pros & cons about this printer.Pros:1. Print quality is best in this class of printer. I have compared it with HP 479fdw and color prints from hp doesn’t even come close to quality of lexmark.2. Color touchscreen provides great advantage of more controlled printing experience.3. Network connectivity and ease of access from ios or android device comes handy during the times when you are on phone and want to print something immediately without starting your laptop.4. It works great with mac.Cons:1. It is super heavy. If you are not taking proper precautions while moving it from one place to another you might break your back or damage printer badly.2. It performs poor with windows and thats why it has been notorious when it comes to reviews. I had to cancel my print jobs many times on windows but small tweaks or a restart resolves the issue.Final thoughts:If you are windows lover and love ease of access you might probably hate some of the complex troubleshooting other Operating Systems involved. Then this is not for you.If you are a techie person and love complex engineering and powerful experience then this printer is for you.Well I had mixed feelings but it hasn’t disappointed me so far.

RJI0VX8V39ZGZ,"July 31, 2019",Summit,1,C3326dw,Vine Customer,Built like a tank & fast,"I'm no stranger to laser printers- I worked my way through the I.T. industry, starting as the 'computer guy' who would come to your office to make your computers function- often elbows deep in a laser printer. Lexmark was originally a part of IBM and was separated in 1991 to be its own thing, but IBM is the go-to company for business class machines- it's even part of their name. The Lexmark printers are well known to business computing people, but probably less known to people who don't work in the computer biz and home users. Their products tend to be built to take a beating and this printer is no exception.One thing that stood out was the steel frame. It's a heavy, industrial quality machine. There isn't any ""fluff"" on it like many printers have- like touch screens and stylistic design. It's simple. The toner tray is unique and the paper tray is more simple than many- but that simplicity makes it durable. The tray latches in with a confident feel. By comparison, my HP color laser has a loose fitting, sloppy paper tray.I don't want more apps on my phone, so I configured this using the super simple little screen and buttons. The longest part was entering the password for the 2.4G network (it isn't compatible with the 5G network, boo...) but despite the simple buttons, it didn't take long as it quickly scrolls through letters and numbers. It connected instantly. I installed the whole software and driver package from the web site and noticed there is a new firmware upgrade as of a couple weeks ago- so I will apply that soon. The web site linked to the icon Lexmark places in their Windows software doesn't work. In fact, I can only bring up the printer settings when printing something- the printer control panel doesn't work any other way. One can also directly connect to the printer's web interface by simply putting the printer IP in a browser window. This is also how one updates the firmware once downloaded.Now, here's where things went a little strange. The printing I get is VERY fast and black and white prints are crisp. It defaults to printing both sides, which is annoying so I have to change settings. Color prints on mine are terrible, but since nobody else is reporting this problem I'm guessing it's because the delivery person tossed this in my driveway. I heard it hit the ground from inside the house. Packaging was minimal- the inside box has the molded foam around the printer but there was no padding between that box and the shipping box. I'll be looking into the problem more after the firmware update but the blue cartridge may be the issue. Printing various solid colors, the blue is extremely blotchy although no sign of toner leakage or damage to the cartridge. Until that is resolved, the color printing on this is extremely poor. Despite the color issue, the grainy appearance when printing a photo quality source is not nearly as good as my 6 year old HP color laser. For now, I'm only taking a star off for the wonky interface and the lousy software. Lexmark has always had wonky interfaces, but they make awesome business class printers. The printing issue on mine appears to be an anomaly and I'll update as I look to resolve it.*** update. all printing is blotchy to the point I can't even use the prints for draft working copies. I've gone through everything possible to attempt to resolve it to no avail. Not looking forward to having to deal with warranty and tech support- but I'll go through all that when I can find extra time to kill.****Second update. After trying a few basic things to try to reset the printer, it has failed to the point where it is now just a waste of space in my house. Warranty? Good luck with that. It was probably damaged when the USPS delivery involved throwing it in my driveway. Dropping off at the recycling depot today where I'll have to PAY to get rid of it.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJI0VX8V39ZGZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,15,1,No,

That said, the past two inkjet printers we've had in our house have started out great and ended horribly, with connectivity issues and smeared pages.So far this is love-at-first-print. Out of the box, this was easy to set up and pretty quick. I did install an app on my phone which made getting it going pretty easy.So far, I'm able to print and the prints are great - both black and white and color turn out great.

Our old printer had to be reloaded often, with a paper tray that holds 250My biggest concern is the cost of replacement toner, but honestly, it might be cheaper in the long run. To keep my last printer going (kind of - with murky prints) I had to replace a maintenance box twice, so the costs were adding up.At the time of writing this, it looks like there is a black toner cartridge return program that costs $85 for the black toner, making the black replacement a little less than 1/2 the cost of the printer itself - so it might just be cheaper to purchase an all-new printer when this one runs out of toner, or at least two colors.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYR0ZINX0GTL0?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,0,0,No,

No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem.

R37KQUV906QNAO,"December 12, 2018",Fbx_Steve,3,MB2338adw,Vine Customer,"Good economy printer for office, but with limitations","The MB2338adw is a good choice for a small office or a workgroup where up-front cost is important and your needs are mainly for printing only. It prints a more-than-adequate 36ppm. It has an automatic document feeder (ADF). However, the ADF is not a duplex scanner. It does print duplex automatically, however. If you are scanning or copying 2-sided documents, you will have to scan one side, then turn it over and scan the other side. Not practical for anything other than occasional use. Essentially, the MB2338adw is positioned as a budget alternative to the more full-featured MB2442adwe, with a slightly slower print speed (36ppm vs 40), lower recommended monthly duty cycle rating (6,000 pages vs. 10,000), no secure print capability, and the lack of a duplex ADF being the primary differences. However, for an average price difference of only around $40, I'm not sure the tradeoffs are worth the modest price reduction.It is a monochrome printer, so it might not be the best choice for a home printer. However, if you are satisfied that you don't need/want to print color at home, it would work at home too. It feels very sturdy and well-made.In testing, it reached (or at least came pretty close) to the 36ppm. I had no desire to burn through 15 or so reams of paper though, so I can't vouch for the monthly volume rating. Print quality was outstanding and it presented no problems using AirPrint from an iPhone or iPad. Setup was a breeze (with Macs, anyway; we don't have any Windows PCs), both wireless and using Ethernet. The instructions are clear and relatively concise (though they are primary illustrated; no/little text). The MB2338adw prints its first page quickly, too, usually spitting out the first page 7-8 seconds after hitting, ""print.""It lacks a feature that most office printers should have, the ability to print securely. If you select this option in the print job dialog, your job won't print until you go to the printer and enter a PIN you selected when printing. This is very useful to ensure that sensivive documents don't print until you are physically at the printer waiting for them. The MB2338adw does not have this ability. There seems to be a reference to it in the manual, but I think that is a mistake.The MB2338adw does have the ability to add an additional, 550-page capacity, input tray. The built-in tray holds 250 sheets, plus there is the usual multi-purpose feeder. The addition of an extra input tray can either give you access to an additional paper size/type, or just add extra capacity of a single size so you don't have to refill as often.There is a cryptic note in the ""Specs"" section on the Lexmark website: ""Product functions only with replacement cartridges designed for use in a specific geographical region."" This appears to mean that replacement cartridges are locked to a specific region, sort of like DVDs; I've personally never heard of this and am just speculating. That may or may not be an issue, but is something you should be aware of.The print quality is outstanding.The all-in-one also sends and receives faxes, but I don't have a landline, so I couldn't test either.Overall, this is a good printer, but with its limitations vs the MB2442adwe, my recommendation is to spend the extra $40 or so to get the additonal features of that printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37KQUV906QNAO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F21DSM8,1,0,No,

R2RAWFZA00JSM3,"November 29, 2018",S. Beck,5,MB2338adw,Vine Customer,LOVE laser printers,"Easiest set up for me thought I've been using different makes of laser printers so I'm a bit familiar.No more dried up ink cartridges every time you need to print. The toner cartridge will last the average household at least a year and it's not going to be dry 2 months from now when you need a printed paper! Most have gotten away from printed filing but, if you do, then laser printers are great and I've always been a fan of Lexmark.Years ago laser printers were for 'big' businesses only due to pricing. Now they're affordable and they are available in color print too. I have found that color really isn't needed for anything we do in our business or house. If I have something that needs color, I upload it and have it printed at an online site or take it on a thumb drive to a local store to print. IF you need any type of printing in your home or office - laser printing is the best in my opinion.Can you tell I absolutely LOVE laser printers?! I have an office in my home for business and I need a printer. Every time I needed to use the old ink jets - the ink would be dry and not print correctly. Then I'd have to go through the print head cleans and thate whole big, waste of time, thing. If this toner print seems to be getting light, I remove the cartridge and tip it back and forth to move the powder toner around and it will be fine (this only happens when it's getting to the end.)I do a lot of printing and I only use one cartridge a year, sometimes I start a second with a month or so remaining.There's only one issue if you're printing labels and that is mentioned in the 'cons' below.In short - the pros -*Toner Cartridge will last and last with no ink to dry up.Saves money over time and no aggravation with dried up ink 2 months from now.*Wireless*Can scan, fax and copythe cons ---* it's a bigger footprint than the compact 'print only' options.*toner cartridges are pricey (but not in comparison to ink and shelf life)*black printing only on this particular monotone model*inside does run hot*i found that some labels will get 'stuck' more than others and a jam can sometimes be 'tricky' with the hot parts.it doesn't happen often though - not often enough for me to even consider going back to ink cartridges!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RAWFZA00JSM3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F21DSM8,3,0,No,

I haven't tried scanning photos yet. Here's the good, the bad and the ugly. The copier (fairly large...more like an office printer) came with a one page (front & back) photo/symbol instruction sheet with no verbiage. I discovered 2 slightly different user guides on the web...the major difference being the connector panel configuration in the rear. Using and de-cyphering the no language, symbols only sheet, I removed all the tape (way more than the four shown on the sheet) and removed the 2 cartridges, rotated them 3X and then reinserted. I was accustomed to pulling a plastic film/tab on other cartridges; Lexmark doesn't use them but they did have a complex plastic harness on one, for want of a better description. The single, non verbiage sheet then clearly shows NOT CONNECTING the MX317 to the computer....this is INCORRECT; I assume the sheet is referring to Lexmark's other model, which is wireless and more expensive. You will need to purchase a USB (a) to USB (b) cable (search Amazon ""USB to printer cable"") and connect the printer to the PC. The instructions show connecting the printer cable (to a router) which won't work since this is the (cheaper) printer connected to a PC model; then the sheet instructs you to turn the printer on (step 14) and lastly inserting the enclosed CD (step 15). I assumed the CD loaded the print driver; which it does,.....BUT...it also contains the step by step instructions (30+ pages or so) in English so....INSERT the disk FIRST and follow these CD instructions...which contradict the single page hieroglyphics sheet. The CD instructs the user to NOT connect the printer cable until the last step. So...to summarize...insert the disk into your PC and follow or print out the CD's instructions. ignore the single sheet hieroglyphics unless you can't read English ..unpack and set up the printer/copier....connect the printer to your PC using a USB to printer (""A"" to ""B"" USB) cable which you must purchase, and follow the setup/programming instructions on the CD disk.... You will also have to program the copier/printer using its ""console"" buttons (select language, time zone, functionality....FTP = file transfer protocol which I don't recommend: if you choose FAX...you'll need to input (and have connected) a land line telephone number.

Previous multifunction fax printer was having issues and despite it being less than nine months old (it was a canon), we had had enough and we’re looking for replacement. Years ago I owned a Lexmark printer. It served me very well, was a workhorse, and I honestly had no complaints and could not have been happier with it. When I was initially looking at this printer I was a bit hesitant. For starters, it being so heavily discounted gave me pause. I was concerned that perhaps people had experienced issues with this model and The remaining stock was being liquidated. I could not have been more wrong. After its initial set up, this machine has been the best fax/printer that we have ever had. It prints quickly with sharp text and images, spools quickly, and has a very speedy fax modem. The fact of the matter is, you won’t find a better deal on an enterprise grade machine that works so well and is so reliable. I will say that, as others have said, if you’re going to use this machine on a local network it would be important to have technical skills. I’m not using it for that purpose since I only connected to one computer. But there are apps available that allow you to print wirelessly via whatever computer you have connected to this printer or any other for that matter. It really is built like a tank. I’m pretty sure this thing could take take a couple of bullets and keep on printing. Just be aware that this is a machine intended for an enterprise environment. That’s not to say that it couldn’t be used in a home office or a small business. Just be aware that this is not a $100 inkjet that you could pick up at Best Buy. The network settings menu is for the technically inclined. With that being said, I am by no means a network engineer. I know how to set up basic Wi-Fi networks in my home and little more. When I received this MFC, I opened the enormous box and plugged in the power, tel, and USB cables and called it a day. If you do not intend to use this on a network, just know that it most definitely can be used in that way and if you do you have the know-how to establish this device on the network you can do that as well. We really have been so impressed by this machine. Lexmark can make a heck of a printer.
