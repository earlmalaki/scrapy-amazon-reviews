Then the minute I needed toner, errors began. With everything! I spent over $300 on four toner cartridges directly from Lexmark’s recycle program: where you use it once and send it back. That was the cheapest I could find for legit toner. That was more than the printer cost in the beginning! Then the errors began. Toner not recognized. Fisher needed attention. Toner waste bottle needed changing although it’s supposed to hold way more than what it’s has in it. One minute it prints. One minute it doesn’t. Since getting it to work with the LEXMARK toner, occasionally it looks faded, with brand new toner! I’ve had other brands of laser printers before and they worked so much better and toner didn’t cost as much as a car payment.

We'll see if it works better hardwired!The touchscreen has so many functions which is great but there's no user manual that comes with it. The one I downloaded from the Lexmark site wasn't helpful at all - augh!After about 4 weeks, I thought I set up the printer driver correctly but after 2 days, it isn't connected to my pc anymore. It's driving me nuts! when it was working, it was great but the frustration of set up and staying connected really outweighs the benefits.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCMLYDN1MZJGM?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,0,1,Yes,"Lexmark products are designed and tested for quality and reliability, so we can understand your frustration.

R3I4D7WN7XZJ95,"March 19, 2020",Animal Friendly,5,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,Good quality build and finish and Win10 sees it easily.,"A great looking printer. Solid and comes with toner. Prints nice like a laser should, and win10 computers see it easily.One note on setup, skip the ""lexmark app"" and just setup from the touchscreen on the printer, it connects to the network and is easy to use from nearby computers. I'm very satisfied once I abandoned the setup QR code and app nonsense. Also don't bother with the included CD.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I4D7WN7XZJ95?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,0,No,
R1THLTVFM0X4PU,"March 16, 2020",Peterc0527,5,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,"Easy setup, good features","We are very low-volume printers. The Lexmark was easy to set up, works well. The apps that go with it (especially Mopria) make printing from tablets and phones easy. There's a Lexmark Scan app that sends the scan to your device instead of requiring a USB drive. My only issue so far is the cost of toner. It's almost as bad as ink-jets. But, the initial toner supply has already lasted quite a while, although we only print a page or two a day.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1THLTVFM0X4PU?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,0,0,No,

No more dried up ink cartridges when I used them once. No more time wasted trying nozzle cleaning and head alignment trying to get it to print right. I don't print very often but when I do, I want it to work right the first time without wasting my time. This printer just wakes up and prints with great quality every time.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KZ00022SBTIG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,1,Yes,We are so happy that you are pleased with your MC3224.

R1IT939HU05BWH,"February 25, 2020",Enrique A Falcon,3,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,THE INSTALLATION SOFTWARE IS INADEQUATE,I bought the printer because of the high quality I got from other printers from Lexmark.The printer itself is excellent. But the installation software is a disaster.The software needed to scan is even worse.
