No,"I was nervous getting this printer due to other reviews of it being extremely difficult to set up to WiFi, I even purchased a direct chord for it just in case. But it was extremely straight forward. I recommend scanning the support QR code provided on the sheet of safety hazards and then watch the videos for setting up the printer and wifi. Follow the video step by step and pause as you go. Also the printer does come with ink.",Bluering,0,"May 21, 2020",R1UJU9DD7I2C54,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Unverified,,5,Printer setup is so straight forward and print quality is great as well,0,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UJU9DD7I2C54?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,Jillian Olivar
No,"Do not buy this printer It is a nightmare to install. After 3 days of tech support, the printer did not work. They are sending a new one. But I still may return it anyway. Its total overkill, don't know how it works and it's too big and heavy with no install instructions. The people at the tech support are great, but the printer still doesnt work. Still trying to hook it up.",Bluering,0,"May 19, 2020",R1YBOUUUC8L0V5,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Verified Purchase,,1,Too hard to install and doesn't work with WiFi,0,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YBOUUUC8L0V5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,Tessa Odowd

No,"So before you buy this printer let me tell you about my issues i had. First i had plugged it in follow the pictures that were given for instructions. (Note: there is no words for the instructions) After i had done so i downloaded the app that it told me to however in the Google play store i did not download the Lexmark printer assistant app which i needed to set it up. I had downloaded the Lexmark print app which was not of help since the printer was not even connected to my WiFi at this point. It took me a good 2 hours just to figure that part out. Then after getting the printer on the WiFi network and all set up on the phone i go to set up on the computer. I have an HP running windows 10 home edition. It took me 4 hours just to get the drivers installed onto the computer and for it to recognized that i had a printer on the WiFi network. I can get test page to print just fine however what i had printed for an actual test print did not print it said error printer offline. The printer clearly says on the little 2 line screen ""Ready"". I started this task at 10:30 am Arizona time it is now 9:33 pm and what i had sent to the printer as a test print is now being printed on its own without my computer being on. Now if only it would print when i tell it to and print the full page not just a half page like the picture i uploaded for reference. JUST DON'T BUY THIS SAVE YOU SELF AND GET A BETTER ONE THAT SOMEONE CAN VOUCH FOR IT.",Bluering,0,"May 16, 2020",R3LGEOVNHZB2N5,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Verified Purchase,,1,Don't buy its a hassle to use,0,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LGEOVNHZB2N5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,Joe Martinez
No,"I bought this printer for the home ""print a few times a year"" use-case after getting tired of dried out inkjet printers.Pros:Print quality looks good. Ethernet connection worked pretty good.Cons:I could not get wi-fi to work with my router. Some other reviews suggested static IP address. Didn't help for me, there was some connection but it wasn't solid enough to be usable. I think I'm just going to have to use it over ethernet.",Bluering,0,"May 12, 2020",R3HR0M3G8ZEGS,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Verified Purchase,,4,"Good print quality, Couldn't get wifi to work",0,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HR0M3G8ZEGS?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,Zoe Clifford
Yes,"Like most printers. It worked great for months and then just decided to stop working. I've spent the last 2 hours trouble shooting and refraining from going full OFFICE SPACE on this thing. It is displaying ""MEMORY FULL"". I've erased the memory. Restarted. Manually put in WiFi password and restarted again. And still it refuses to print. Always a job you need printed immediately. smh.Could not get a hold of tech support. They do not make it easy.",Bluering,1,"May 12, 2020",R6YI85ACO0VWM,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Verified Purchase,"Thank you for the feedback.

No,"ink replacement program is not accepting any new comers, yet they still sell the product.... It costs less to buy a whole new printer than to replace the ink.

No,"It's a great printer. Fast, does a beautiful job, no sarcasm here.At the time of this writing, it costs under $200.

No,"I have to say that I've had a lot of printers in my life, but this one seems to be the easiest I've had to get connected to WiFi. And I can print from my iPhone! Any computer just connects and prints, without even any setup on the devices/laptops. Impressive. Perfect size - not too big. All the features. Good price.
