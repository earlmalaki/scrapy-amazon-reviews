NON STOP PROBLEMS.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11KPE3MQXB3T7?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"DO NOT BUY. NON STOP PROBLEMS.Once you fix one problem, another occurs and prevents you from printing/scanning/faxing. We first came across the SMTP server issue. We contact support, and after an hour, still no luck. However, we ending fixing it ourselves. Once we got the printer working and onto our network, it continues to show error state when printing to any computer that tries to print to it. Too much maintenance comes with this printer. Do not recommend it."
R2TJU4SF8JIXJK,"February 22, 2020",Kelly Pfister,Verified Purchase,4,MB2236adw,N/A,2,0,No,Lexmark MB2236,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TJU4SF8JIXJK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"I like the printer, however I found out after the fact that there is no local scan to PC option and scanning must be done via the cloud. Had I know this, I would have picked a different all-in-one. That being said, I like how this one prints and the fact that it prints double sided. It is also easy to make copies. Update 2/27/20 I figured out that this will scan to your local PC if you use Windows Fax and Scan. Also, there are some open source software scanners that will also allow you to scan on your local PC. I am using NAPS2 and it works great with this."

R33RH2BI744UBU,"December 10, 2019",CJ,Verified Purchase,1,MB2236adw,N/A,0,0,No,Very difficult to install,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33RH2BI744UBU?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"This product is not very intuitive to use like any other printers I've had before. Literally trying to print was the hardest part to do because there's literally no instructions for it. It gives you step by step picture guide on how to unwrap your printer but actually using it, you are on your own. I tried to look at their website but it's just the same video on how to remove a sticker, etc. I am not ignorant about computers and technology but again, the set-up for this printer is ridiculous. Buyer beware."
R3LW0NN16FHC9M,"November 1, 2019",Theresa J.,Unverified,1,MB2236adw,N/A,5,0,No,Scanner functionlity,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LW0NN16FHC9M?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"Looks good and reads well on Amazon, however this printer is dysfunctional for everyday use. There is no USB port to print to and for scanning you have to open an application even though the printer key pad option actually have a scan prompt cability. When you use that function, it gives you a hard copy of the document. The technical support team lacks the knowledge about the printer functionalities. In fact when they cannot answer a practical question they lie instead. One tech by the name Yury Alexandra Espinosa Piratoba was very dishonest about calling me back.... still waiting. The case number she gave to me does not exit according to another tech support member. The chat request gives an error after submitting"

Why oh why didn't I believe the other reviewers??? Anyway, after 2 hours over 2 different days, with 2 different techs, I can FINALLY send docs from the scanner to my PC! I haven't actually used it for it's intended purpose (I'm a NSA who needs to scan back large numbers of pages to my PC and upload to secure servers). I have a job this evening...I hope it goes well.With that said, if you want to just print your scans, it may be easy peasy."

Once I unpacked it, I was able to Get it going by connecting it to my wifi at home. It is fast, has great color and it quiet. I haven’t tried to fax anything and I won’t use that feature. But the scanning works great and does the printing. I am very happy!"
