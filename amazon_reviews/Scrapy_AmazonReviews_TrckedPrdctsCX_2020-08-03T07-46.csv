R308V8ELPTPG08,"July 30, 2020",James M. Mcguire,3,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Printer is working but it's a returned printer.,"While setting printer up I noticed a few things that were not right. The tabs that you are required to remove for each color and black printing were missing. Next, when I opened the paper tray, there was paper already in it. When I went through the setup, I found it had already been set up once before in May of this year (this is July). Clearly, I didn't get the NEW printer I had ordered. The WiFi setup was harder than any other printer I have used to date (I've set up 5 since WiFi was an option), but I finally got it working. Print quality is OK for B/W text but not dark and uniform when using large fonts. The user manual was missing but I downloaded it on a PDF. Oh yeah, there was no registration card for warranty purposes. We'll see how hard it will be to register it online.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R308V8ELPTPG08?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R3LQOVVEX25D52,"July 16, 2020",kmt22,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Not good,"I did not believe the one star reviews mixed 50/50 with five star reviews - I wish I had. I bought this to use with Android phones in my household. If this printer works well, it must only be for certain phone types. This review is for use with the LGV50 ThinQ and Samsung Note 8.- Documentation is inadequate or non-existent. It's enough to get cartridges installed and printer turned on. After that, virtually no online reference to this specific printer exists, whether it be detailed manuals, online forums discussing specific problems, mobile drivers, etc. The only ""support"" that is useful is this page of Amazon customer reviews.- Wireless setup is cumbersome but not impossible. I was able to connect to my home wifi and produce a Wi-Fi direct network using the front panel. Feels like texting did in the year 2003, tapping each character out. It's easy to set a static IP address if desired, but this made no improvement in my ability to connect.- Due to wireless connectivity issues, I purchased a USB-B to USB-C cable. That's right, this does not support multi use USB and requires the ancient square USB type which I specially ordered on Amazon. No USB cables were supplied with my printer.- The Lexmark app from the Google play store specifically does not support this model of printer. I was able to load my doc but in the end, no connection to the printer. That leaves third party apps only.- Printers could be set up and available in my printer apps, but when selected, the printer is always ""unavailable right now."" Even when the printer happened to recognize a connection which I accepted on its front panel, the app would return ""internal printer error."" It takes over an hour of cycling apps and connection types to finally get a connection. I have had intermediate success with Samsung Print Service (even on my LG phone) and NoKo Print (over USB only). I have never been able to print from Lexmark Print or Mopria (supposed to be the universal standard of mobile print drivers with a consortium of manufacturers).- Note that print is only possible for photos and pdfs. Do not expect to print a webpage or other content without making a pdf first, unless specifically supported by the app.- The buffer is small. It will print one page, pause, print the next, pause. This takes up a lot of time for multi page documents.- Print quality is as expected from a cheap laser printer. Relatively crisp depending on the document. Occasionally get a thin red stripe down one side of the page. Pictures are ok, not great.- The thing weighs 50 pounds. How can I return that?? Get a strong desk or stand.In the end, this printer will let you down. If you are unlucky enough that your device doesn't play nicely, there is no remedy. I spend around an hour fighting with the printer each time I need something, usually an important form or tax document. Sometimes I just give up. And it doesn't even have a scanner, so it has no redeeming qualities. Save your money and go to a brick and mortar store to purchase a printer that is known to work with mobile devices. They cost more because they WORK. I am sorry I bought this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LQOVVEX25D52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

The price was right and Lexmark does have a good reputation. While the quality of printing and copying is good the software interface is just awful. It's clear that the lexmark programmers are sloppy and just not in tune with reality. User instructions are poor, and even the online stuff is bad. The printer is constantly going into ""offline"" mode and there is no way to change that except to unplug the device. You can;t even power down and then up again to reset it. You actually have to disconnect the power cord. So dumb. The scanner/copier feeder is also poor in that it can only handle about 5 pages otherwise it gets jammed.Scanning is also another issue as you actually have to set up the email account on the printer to get it to work or use a USB stick. Also dumb.

R16KJZQTOTLVJC,"July 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,1,MC3326adwe,Verified Purchase,toner costs more than the printer,"I print a lot, and I knew that I would be changing out an ink cartridge every week at the rate I print. I wanted a color printer since I do print documents and articles with color prints and images. Instead of an inkjet I decided to buy this laser printer, anticipating it would be cheaper in the long run than inkjet. I was wrong. After the 2nd week of having it I ran out of black toner which the printer informed me was low. I ordered the toner ($90 by the way), you have to order it since it is not sold in stores, (tried staples, best buy, office max, walmart, target, costco, etc). After the toner arrived I installed it and tried to print but it would not print since now the color toners were out. It did not mention that. I thought ok, I will only print in black and white or grayscale until I can get the color toner replaced. NOPE it will not print if any toner is out. I look up the color toner to purchase and it cost $100 MORE than the printer cost!!! I should have looked at that before buying the printer but I did not expect it to be so expensive. It is now a VERY expensive paperweight, as I refuse to pay more for my toner than for my printer. I ended up buying an inkjet, and although I will probably spend more money in the long run, I live paycheck to paycheck, I can purchase a $30 ink cartridge here and there, I can not drop $350 all at one time for toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KJZQTOTLVJC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,3,0,No,

R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ,"July 20, 2020",So disappointed,5,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,Amended review,"I purchased this printer after a great deal of long research. I broke my beloved canon and had been wanting to buy a color laser for over a year, and I purchased it after reviews from Amazon. I was aware the toner would not last very long, the estimate ranged from 200-300 pages, but the yellow toner ran out after only a few pages, and the printer would not print except in black without two yellow streaks down the side of the page. Prior to that, the print quality was fantastic -- it was super easy to set up - my computer did all the work -- it is connected to my printer via a cord, so I'm not doing any wireless printing -- I'm old, and I print mainly from digitals stored in my computer, so wireless is not a necessity for me -- Even though the printer was advertised as ""new"" I was concerned it had been returned -- I contacted Amazon via chat, and the young man that resolved my issue could not have been more helpful -- I could not find any generic or after-market cartridges such as ones available for canon and HP. I finally found replacement Lexmark cartridges from a company called quill.com -- at the most reasonable price I could find -- it was still $80, but it's supposed to last for roughly 600 pages -- this is the recycling program, which I like -- you could buy a cartridge with longer life for about $20 more -- also, I watched videos on youtube about replacing the toner powder at home and then resetting the printer chip -- you can buy toner for about $13 -- that may be an avenue I experiment with -- but as far as ease of use and print quality, I love it very much -- I make journals and one of the downfalls is, if you get a drop of water on an inkjet image, the whole page is ruined because it will smear -- I've had mono laser printers since the 1990's, so I knew if you act quickly, it could be saved -- when the printer arrived, I did a lot of water tests, and was very pleased with the results. Now that I know I can find cartridges at a reasonable cost, I'm much happier -- if you purchase from this seller, contact them prior to shipping -- shipping was delayed, and I still wonder if this was a returned printer -- so get sales person's name and write down exactly what they tell you.

R1CLTKNQSPQYOF,"July 19, 2020",Donald V. Rutkowski Jr.,1,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,The scanner functional is not efficient.,"The printer was easy to setup and I was printing paper within minutes. Now the scanner part, is a whole different story. After spending about 4 to 5 hours trouble shooting the scanner issue, I finally figured out how to scan from the printer to the computer and its not efficient at all.First you have to download the ""Lexmark Scanback Utility"", which is not part of the original driver package. Once you install and start running the utility, you will create a scanner profile. Second, you have to go back to the printer, load the paper you want to scan, then select the scanner profile you created. Once that is all done, you have successfully scanned your document.

It's not too difficult. The printer arrived where the carton appeared to be in excellent condition. The unit is well padded, and plenty of security tape to keep doors, trays and lids in place during shipping. Getting the printer up and running was easy for both the Mac and PC systems. The catch with this printer is the paper tray. The tray isn't the best solution in the printer industry. Considering the printer is 50 lbs. in weight, I'd assume the paper tray would have been constructed with metal guides and a solid tray solution. Not the case, it is all plastic. The tray and the printer paper *pick up function* didn't work well right out of the box. Of several 10's of sheets of different paper, none of the paper used would be successfully drawn from the tray to be printed. The printer *pick up function* from the tray was inadequate, with only one sheet out of 20+ attempts to print with this printer.Paper used: HP Premium 20 lb. paper HP Premium 24 lb. paper HP Premium 32 lb. paper HP Mulitpurpose 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Paper 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Plus 20 lb. paperThe tray filled with each of the different paper types, filed at full capacity, half capacity, near empty capacity... the results were the same. Every type of paper would begin its journey as the *pick up mechanism* would extract about 2 inches of the top sheet, then slice two one inch tears into the edge of the paper. The printer would report the *tray out of paper.* Clearly there's something wrong with this printer, at least the one received. The remedy to clear the ""out of paper"" error was to remove the tray, remove the damaged top sheet, then install the tray, and do the same thing over, and over, and over again.The price for a scanner, printer, fax, copier machine is reasonable, but if it doesn't work, it's a waste of time.The other Lexmark printer owned for several months/years is the model C2535.

This compact color MFP can fit almost anywhere. (13. 6 x 16. 2 x 15. 5 inches / 344. 4 x 411. 2 x 394. 1 mm), according to its makers. It is also, according to its makers, easy to use: its makers claim that it is plug it in and ready to go. Furthermore, they add that its standard wi-fi makes it easy to print from mobile devices.That it is interconnective: its 2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information. That it will enable the user to scan to network, email, FTP, or USB stick drive, scan to, print files from popular cloud services with Lexmark's Cloud Connector, while providing security. That its extra high yield unison toner will provide up to 4, 500 pages of output, so the user can print more, stop less. And it is durable, as its steel frame, long-life imaging components mean it’s built to last. So the user can get solid performance, get things done with a 1-GHz dual-core processor, output up to 26 ppm. The manufacturers also state that the printer, with its Unison Toner, will deliver rich, vibrant color with crisp details, for outstanding quality. The manufacturers also claim that this printer will deliver media flexibility, enabling the user to get universal media handing from A6 to legal; support for specialty media like envelopes, optional input expandable up to 751 pages. Form Factor: All-In-One; paper Size: 8.5 X 11.So, OK, to begin with,at 50 lbs., I would call it heavy; I needed help to get it off my front porch, though I was comforted by the idea that most thieves probably couldn’t lift it either. Then, setting it up is anything but easy: the makers offer a coupla pages of weird diagrams, no written instructions, and a CD. Whose computer has CD portals anymore? Then, it doesn’t print pictures, to those of you who might want to. And it needs lithium batteries which are difficult to fit, pricey. But my main problem with it was my difficulty in figuring out the scan function, which is not even listed on its index of available functions. ( And, by the way, its touch screen is tiny.) And figuring out how to scan was difficult even with the help of my professional computer guru.

R8Z4KZYQ63GSK,"May 26, 2020",S. Brown,2,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,no documentation and heavier than most printer stands can take,"I was excited to be offered to test and review this printer. Most of the places I’ve worked at have had Lexmark printers as they are such workhorses. But I haven’t personally owned one and so never had to try to set one up before.First thing you need to know is that this printer is HEAVY. It comes in at 50 pounds. And until I got this, I had no idea that almost all printer stands will only support a printer of 30 pounds. It took me awhile to find a stand that would be big enough (it also has a larger footprint than my previous printers) and sturdy enough and rated to handle the weight of this. After I found one and ordered it, I was contacted by the seller, in very broken English, asking me to please cancel the order because they really didn’t have any stands! After many more hours of searching, I gave up on printer stands and found instead a “roll cart with drawers” (no longer available) that was big enough and rated to hold the weight. After it finally arrived, I then had to assemble it and wait for the glue to dry before I could use it.So now the printer is on the stand and I am ready to set it up. Not. There are no directions or manual or any real info with this. All it came with are several pages of pictures showing you how to remove all the tape and packing material in, on and around the printer. The only other thing they show is putting the CD into your computer. I tried that. It did NOTHING. The CD does not have a manual or info or anything like that on it. Instead it appears to be a program that will auto install the drivers and optionally some utilities. However, you have to first have the printer on your wifi.There are NO directions or information on how to connect to your wifi. On all of my previous wifi printers, they came with detailed, step by step directions that were easy to follow. This printer leaves you to figure it out yourself. First issue is the password.The touch screen “buttons” you need to press to enter your password as so tiny that I found it impossible to know if I pressed the right one. This is due to the fact that the screen does not show you what you pressed! Not even momentarily. Nope, it gives you nothing but asterisk. Maybe if I had a short password, it would be ok, but ours is very long and a mix of letters and numbers. I tried repeatedly, but it would not work for me. After a few more days I found an old rubber tipped stylus and that helped. They next problem was with our router (I didn’t have anything to do with the purchase of this or it’s setup – it is NOT one I would have chose).I finally seemed to have gotten the right combination of “buttons” on the printer and the router pushed and with the stylus, the right characters for the password input and it connected to wifi. Running the CD was easy and I did install one of the optional programs.You would think all is fine finally and I would be able to use the printer. And you would be wrong. I thought I would start by scanning in some art that I recently finished. On almost every printer I’ve worked with before, there would be a “button” for “print”, “fax”, “copy”, and “scan”. Nothing so simple on this one. The only “scan” option says “scan profiles”. Since there are no instructions for anything, I push that. Big mistake evidently. The printer locked up. It was completely non-responsive.After 30 minutes, I gave up and pulled the plug. That seemed to reset it from the beginning when I first turned it on. It did however, remember the network and connect itself without my intervention. It takes several minutes to get itself ready. Now I no longer have the “scan properties” option.So this time I decided to try printing from the cloud. I signed into One Drive through Word and saved this document. Went to the printer and selected One Drive. It makes me give it a name for some weird reason then tells me I have to go to a website and read pages of legalese and agree then input a code. I did all of that and found myself at a sign in to One Drive. Weird. I just signed in. So I sign in here and see nothing for me to do and can not find the cloud storage from here. It just got me to my account info with Microsoft.I go back to the printer, figuring I did what it said so I was good to go. NOT. The printer is showing me the code again and telling me I have to go agree and input the code on the website. Round and round we go. I again hit ok. BTW, before you can type that URL in and connect, the printer will flip screens so you have to again click several times to get back to the code so you can type it in. I again agree, and again am set to sign in with Microsoft. This time, MS asks if I want to let my printer have access to my cloud. Amongst the things I expected, for some reason Lexmark also is saying it has to have full access to my profile. Not sure why it would need that to print but I don’t save much to the cloud so I don’t really need to be concerned – I hope.So, I grant access and end up back at Lexmark which now has a message that I am ALMOST done. That now that it is set up, I HAVE to print from the cloud within 72 hours or it will delete all of this info and I have to start all over again. Fine. Whatever. I select the cloud and the named profile and find my directory tree as in OneDrive. Choose something to print and not sure what to do next. I take a chance and press the arrow and it prints. So that at least seems to work as advertised after you jump through the hoops.Print quality was excellent and the photos and illustrations came out fantastic. There was no banding in the gradients and the colors were good. Very pleased with this part of the printer.I can’t find any options to scan except scan to cloud. That is extremely disappointing. I don’t see why there isn’t a scan to computer option like all my other printers have had. That makes an extra step for me. Scan to cloud, go to cloud to retrieve. Why? That is just dumb. I guess they figure you only use this for business and not for ever using with photos or graphics that need repair or retouch/rework in a program on your computer.So my low rating is mainly due to the lack of documentation. I have lots of options when I click on things but no idea what they mean or do. I don’t really have the time to sit and hit all the buttons to see what happens. I have things I need it to do and simply want to know how to do them. I shouldn’t have to first figure it out on my own.-------------It is now August 2020 and I have been online and found the documentation. While it is helpful, the printer still requires you to jump through a ton of hoops to do everything except a straight print from computer.I use my printers to scan in documents and this is NOT easy on this printer. It can be done but with many many unneeded steps in comparison to EVERY single printer I have ever owned.You have to open the scan utility. I had to download that software and install first. Then you have to pick what size document you want to scan. Fine. You would think that would be it. That the printer would be smart enough for you to select this ONCE and done. Then if you needed to make a change, you would go back and change it. NO doesn't work like that.You have to give it a profile name. That name is then sent to the printer under the very unintuitive menu item of ""shortcuts"". Then you click on shortcuts and then your name and then it will do it. However it will always use the same path name and same file name for every time. NOT useful.To make it work, I set up two different profile ""shortcuts"" (interesting that they don't both appear on the printer - only the one at a time). Then I make a desktop shortcut. One is for legal sized and one is for letter. It will not print any larger than letter, but it will scan larger.So I pick either the letter or the legal desktop shortcut I made. It gives me a dialog box on the computer that I MUST answer NO to in order for this to work. if I answer yes, the scans will always over write each other. only THEN can I go over to the printer, wake it up by pushing the arrow ""button"", wait until it gives me the screen and find ""shortcuts"" then the name of the ""profile"". I forget what it is called, but I think it is just scan. I can't get it confused because I only ever see the one associated with the desktop shortcut!Then I put the item on the glass and push the arrow button again and it scans.what a huge PITA. I have never had to jump through so many hoops to do almost everything with a printer. It insists that you create profiles and each one has to have a name before it will do anything. But every time I look, there are no profiles listed in the menu. Very odd. You have to jump through this naming garbage to use the cloud print or scan also.I guess you could say I love/hate this thing. It works well, just it is a royal pain to use.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8Z4KZYQ63GSK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,2,1,No,

This Lexmark is a step up from the quality that I’m used to from them. The construction doesn’t feel as cheap or shoddy, and it actually feels like a fairly solid printer. I like that they’re upping the quality for home laser printing. I much prefer laser quality over ink, and they have not disappointed in that regard. The toner replacement seems a little steep, but if you’re getting 4500 pages as opposed to 500, it can average out.That being said, the touch screen is a little too small for my fingers, and makes it difficult to use. The setup is pretty straight forward and easy with no real surprises if you have any kind of familiarity with printer set up. Which is good, because the “manual” that comes with it doesn’t really explain anything.

R2T03U91SZ94NP,"May 19, 2020",Jon R,1,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, hampered by terrible software","The short version: Don’t bother with this, while the hardware is good it’s paired with terrible software that ruins the experience. You can get much better for the same price, in fact it’s actually on the upper end of what I’d consider reasonable pricing. You can probably get the same or better for even less if you look for sales.Longer version:As I said the printer hardware is nice. It’s not too big for a color laser, prints clearly on every paper type, is fairly quiet, and fast. I’d give the hardware a 4/5 if Lexmark could hire someone who knew anything about software to fix the garbage software this thing runs.Now first let me side track a bit because this needs mentioning. The instructions that come with this are ridiculous. You get a about 7 pages of paper with no words, just photos (poor ones at that) and a CD. Honestly, who still has a CD drive on their computer? If they want to throw one in, fine, but they also need a thumb drive or just tell you where to go to download manuals and let you know to do it online. The good news is those do exist, but you have to go to Lexmark’s website and find it yourself. I work in IT, so I knew how to setup a printer, but not everyone does. Those pictures (I’m not even going to call them instructions) are not going to help anyone.Now with that out of the way back to my reason for rating this printer low despite the nice hardware. The crap software. So the first thing I ran into was the printer suggested using an app to set it up faster. That’s cool, other printer have done that and it can be easier then trying to set it up on those small screens. Except this app just doesn’t work. For one thing it’s about as bare bones as you can get, and looks like it hasn’t been updated in years (and the update notes suggest it hasn’t, they only added support for newer printers). It couldn’t find the printer, which is expect during setup but it gave no instruction on how to connect to the printer. I finally got it to see the printer by using my phone’s WiFi direct. Except the app, either due to poor design or a bug, did not do any setup it went right to the main screen, and once again complained about not finding the printer. I gave up on that and decided to do it on the printer itself. I don’t think even the most petite persons fingers could type on that keypad. It took several tries to get the passwords to match because you can't see what you are typing, so I kept making typos. Next up was WiFi. Connecting to the network took a few tries, again, because there are not clear instructions included nor onscreen instructions. Once I was connected, it worked but again I am in IT and know about these things. Someone not in IT probably would have a harder time. Now begins another annoying adventure - I get through the needlessly annoying setup and arrive at the main screen. Several things have a lock beside them so I try to enter my password from earlier to unlock them, and it doesn’t work. I guess I might have typed it wrong since the keypad is so hard to use. So I go into settings and find the option to do a factory reset, nothing happens when I tap it. After some frustration I realize you have to restart the printer for the reset to happen – why wouldn’t it tell me that? Ok annoying setup again, this time I say screw the password and just make it 12345, it’s not like anyone else has access to this. Ok good news is that the password works now. Now the thing has the wrong region? What? It doesn’t let me change it either. I tried ANOTHER reset and during setup the region was STILL locked to the wrong location. After much frustration I found it can be changed via the web interface. FINALLY the printer is ready to use.First thing I try is via my phone since I have it with me. I try their app, because the app for my HP printer had been handy. Lexmark’s app is as useless as that setup app, bare bones, and outdated. I just decided to use Android’s printing and that worked. Next up my iPad. Since this is an Airport printer I decided to use that. Well, Airport was a no-go, it could never connect. I tried their iOS app and it was no better then their Android one. So basically it’s a no-go for iOS printing. And final my Windows PC. Their Windows software is trash like the rest. Windows couldn’t find the printer without Lexmark’s crap software. But I used the old manual printer setup to manually enter the IP and it was able to connect and print.See the pattern here? Lexmark should hire some high school kid to go and recode all their software, because it’s obvious nobody there knows how to do it. When you factor in the headaches this terrible software will give you, this printer is not worth the price.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T03U91SZ94NP?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,1,2,No,

R2LG9CZCCKIY1W,"June 21, 2020",Matt P.,4,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Excellent, Fast Printing In A Heavy Plastic Housing","Lexmark is known to make some excellent printers, both large and small, for business and home use. This model could be used easily for a home office, and for a small business that needs high quality prints. Set up on this is easy and straightforward, and can be used with WiFi or Ethernet. App is available for WiFi set up. i was very disappointed in the touch screen, where all your settings and options are found. This Lexmark sells for $259.00 (as of this review), and for that money, if it's gonna have a touch screen, it should be at least big enough to see the text, and definitely big enough for your fingers to be able to use it. The description states ""2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information"". I hardly believe it to be ""convenient interaction"" at all, when I had to enter my password for WiFi, literally, I had to do it like 5 times. I know my password, but the keyboard is so small, even my smaller fingers had a tough time landing on the touch key correctly, and hitting the right letter or number. There's plenty of real estate on here that another inch would not have interfered with anything, and made a world of difference. The price of screens like this has pretty much dropped to rock bottom, they are so widely produced, so don't understand. I have a $69 Canon that has a touch screen at least 50% bigger, and much easier to use than this.As others have stated, the paper tray is a little flimsy, not falling apart flimsy, but not as exact as I thought it would be. The entire housing looks like it's made of plastic (it states it has a metal frame), and although that in itself is not bad, it's just some parts, like the tray, could have used a little more support, and sliding in and out, it could have used a sturdier slide than what it has. If I had bought a printer for under $100 bucks (which there are more than enough of those to choose from, and getting better quality every day), this is what I would expect. As far as the main feature, and what this is built for, printing, it's excellent. Prints are sharp, even the smallest print. Pictures are color perfect, even at 8x11, they look great. All print out quickly, and to me, quietly. I know some have stated this is a loud printer. The only times I notice it is loud was the initial setup, and if it's been totally shut down. I leave mine on standby, and pretty much just makes a kind of fan running sound when it's printing, quiet to me, and then goes back to sleep until I wake it again. FYI: This is a printer only. I think a lot of people (like my wife too, was wondering where you lift up to scan and make a copy, it doesn't, this is a one trick pony, but it's excellent at it. If you are looking for a high quality printer function only, for professional looking work, this can do the job. It's also expandable to a second tray if you need to do a lot of printing. Toner is not cheap, depending on where you shop I guess. Average price I found, for the black cartridge only, was about $100 bucks, at a very well known national office supply company. But, printer toner is known to vary wildly in price, and tomorrow it could be $19.99, who knows. Overall, an excellent printer, in a good looking, VERY heavy, plastic housing. If you don't care about anything else about this printer, except that you want perfect, professional looking print, at a reasonably priced small office printer, this is your man (printer). Lexmark makes great printers, this is one of them, and my only major gripe was the screen, and the paper tray a minor gripe. Other than that, even my other printer I had for a few years because it always performed so well (from a very well known company that also makes good printers, and sold for around the same price as this), didn't print as well as this when it came to precision print. For the price, I'm impressed with the print, and worth the asking price (especially if they decide to do something with that screen!)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LG9CZCCKIY1W?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,

I connected it manually via the touchscreen, worked just fine but a bit tedious entering in the wifi password as it requires running through entire numbers and alphabet. It does allow for scrolling through so it didn't take too long - just a different process via the touch screen.Very fast printing. I'd say the printing speed is the best feature. Two-sided ejects the paper then draws it back in for the second side printing. There's a little stop-paper shield to keep the paper from flying off the top of the printer but we haven't needed to use that yet as all the print jobs have been small. There's an additional paper tray for larger paper. The main letter sized paper tray is in front, easy to fill, and fits flush with the printer.This printer is a big heavier than most probably due to the large ink cartridge. It's a bit noisier than I expected.Comes with picture only instructions sheet and a DVD.Works well for a home or small business. There's Apps that can be downloaded either Apple or Android phones.I downloaded the Apps but was able to just print from my phone email. However, on one of our laptops we kept getting an error code.

RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",V-TEAM,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,3,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively.

They aren't sold on amazon that I could find (or anywhere else for that matter). I think I ordered the correct thing on the Lexmark website, but it cost me over $120. I personally can't afford a replacement cartridge every month at that price. On top of that, the website reads that there are only ""5 items left in stock,"" which I assume is now 4 that I just ordered one.

RH9GU757CDJQ9,"June 28, 2020",Jimster480,4,B3340dw,Vine Customer,A fast printer with an easy setup but a weird amount of network usage,"I setup this printer to replace my 6 year old $50 laser that has been chugging along faithfully. I've tested out a few other printers in the last months but this one is my favorite so far.The Good:- Has double sided printing (has to be a 2 page + document though)- Very fast printing (wake up to print time is around 14 seconds, only around 4 seconds if its on ""sleep"") and definitely hits its 40ppm claim. I did print out over 20 sheets for my son (single sided) in one clip and it was done in under 1 minute (including warm up time from ""sleep).- The printer Has Ethernet and a screen where everything can be setup without a PC even if it takes a little while on the 2 line screen. I was able to plug it into my network and get it working via the printer only in about 5 minutes.- Print Quality is very good; much better than my old $50 laser which is impressive considering how fast it spits the pages out!- Large Paper Tray; Holds 250 sheets and actually has a meter that tells you how much paper there is (in 3 different tiers of full, Nearly Full, OK) in the printer. Paper tray can be adjusted to various different types of paper so cards and other smaller formats can be printed.- Has a 50 sheet bypass tray in the back for separate paper types.- Drivers make it easy to setup duplexing and paper sizes.- Allows for PIN based print and hold features for offices; so users can print confidential documents that they will need to enter a pin to physically print out (printer will hold the print job in memory until it is retrieved).- Supports PCL5e; great for workgroups and other network printing scenarios.- Supports Wifi-Direct; this allows for direct printing from laptops or mobile devices without needing to be on the local network. You can enable to disable this in the options menu.- Supports Google Cloud Print: It can be toggled with a single button in the operator menu.- Super easy website user interface; Every area has easy drop down options and even firmware can be easily updated with a couple clicks via this page (printer local IP address). Check the included image to see what the page looks like.- Supports 500+ page paper trays or multiple paper trays. There is a whole family of printers from Lexmark that share paper trays; giving you many options to expand your paper capacity if need be.Cons- Has a coil whine that repeats 2x/second when its on ""sleep"" mode; must put printer into hibernate (which takes between 30-40 seconds to wake up) to make this go away.- Default windows driver install on a ""detected"" printer only contains the MAC address and not the name of the printer. Also has weird printing limitations and doesn't work properly. Drivers from the website are required to fix this.- 2 Line screen has poor viewing angles requiring you to be over the top of the printer to view it.- Rear Bypass tray requires Printer to not be near a wall. You need a full foot + behind the printer to be able to use it. Making it pretty useless in most applications since the power, ethernet, USB connections are around the bypass tray.- Uses a bunch of data on the network; I logged over 300MB in a day of data transfer without any printing. This seems to happen even when its on hibernate. My other printers use less than 1MB a day of data. I am not sure why this printer keeps sending 200kb every minute or so.Conclusion:I think I will be keeping this one to use it for my kids. Toner prices are decent with 3000 page toner cartridges available for under $90 (at the time of writing) and 1500 page ones available under $60.Considering the price of toner for some other printers on the market; this is both affordable and competitive.Overall this is a great printer for the money; it is very fast, prints with great quality and has a smaller form factor. Unlike other printers I have tested; this one I can actually recommend. It seems to also go on sale pretty frequently; meaning that you might be able to pick it up at an even better deal than the regular price.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful!

I've been through a number of them over the last few years and only an old Epson laser printer has held up. Printers are cheap and used as delivery devices for consumers to buy print supplies. That said, I'll do my best to update this review if anything changes.The MC3426adw is a heavy printer with the box weighing in at over 40 lbs. Once unpacked it's a simple matter of removing the packing material and all of the tape. Plug it in, start it up, and you're in business. The interface on the little LED screen itself is easy to figure out, and it's a good thing because there is very little documentation. You won't need it for setup, anyway.There's an app that you can use to test prints. I grabbed a few images off my phone and they printed without issue and very quickly. There's also a Lexmark cloud that you can store and print from.The print cartridges are beefy and will probably be expensive to replace, so hopefully they last for a long time.This is a big and solid printer and I've had no issues at all after a month of use. Setup is easy and prints are clean. At this point this is a great printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HU2D79MH5ZHV?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,0,0,No,

The quality of the print was also really good.The printer had all the plastic locks present which needed to be pulled off and it would be ready to be used. The setup for the fax was straight forward as well. The scanning gives out good quality results as well. The speed of copying and printing is impressive with laser technology.The color combination of the printer is CMYK which gives brilliant color printing. The Duplex copy is just a great addition.

R2YVVW81VEBQQC,"May 1, 2020",Drew's Reviews,4,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,"Gorgeous Prints, Excellent 2 Sided Scanning & Easy Setup","While I have setup and used laser printers in office settings this is the first laser printer I have had for home use.Laser printers have many advantages over inkjet, the primary of those being print quality and speed. The disadvantage, and reason they are used less often in home settings, is purchase price and toner cost.This Lexmark MC3426adw printer is standard size for similar workstation units and comes with everything you’ll need to get it setup and running.While it came with an installation CD I opted for downloading the app and software which was easily located on the Lexmark website rather than pullout my external CDROM. The iOS app was easy to use and connected the workstation to my network without any issue.I work on a Windows 10 PC and had no problems whatsoever with setup and using all of the functions.I have put this workstation through a full battery of testing and I am thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. I have found the Dual Core, 1.0 GHz processor can handle any tasks I throw at it with ease.In terms of printing - text is printed crisp, clean and flawless. Speed of printing is incredible when compared to inkjet - really there is just no comparison. In addition it prints both sides of the page at the same time! Printing graphics, images and photos was likewise excellent. While I don’t typically print photos and instead upload them to professional photo services, I found the printed image quality far superior to anything I’d ever previously produced at home.When it comes to scanning, this workstation is a powerhouse of performance. It is able to scan both sides of a page at the same time allowing it to make short work of even large stacks of scanning jobs. The results of my scanning tests were very good and the speed is phenomenal.This workstation is highly versatile allowing for an expanded media tray to be added and high capacity toner cartridges if you have especially large projects. It is able to print on to envelopes and multiple sizes of media with no problem. It connects to the major cloud platforms and will easily upload and download with them. There is a built in USB port on the front for scanning to flash media and, of course, it’s available via Wifi or Ethernet.The only flaw I have found with this otherwise great product is the touch screen. On a device this size there is no reason for the touchscreen to be so minuscule. While I don’t find that I have to use the touchscreen often, when I do it’s difficult to key anything in without miskeying.While toner costs more than it would for an inkjet it is in line with other brands and is readily available. Each color in addition to black is individually packaged so you only change the cartridge that is needed without wasting the others.This is an outstanding color laser printer, scanner and fax machine that is made to perform. I have been impressed by each of the many features it has and definitely recommend this product.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YVVW81VEBQQC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,1,0,No,

R2QFFOJ62ANPQ8,"April 27, 2020",Dave Lakhani,1,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,Updating Review to 1 Star - Print quality is great but set up and instructions are terrible,"I'm updating my review to 1 star. If you can get the printer to work and stay connected to a network, the rest of my earlier review stand. I had to change routers, I could not reconnect to the new router. I tried chatting with their support who said they'd have someone call me. I got a call fxrom a tech who had difficulty understanding that the printer wasn't connecting to the network and asked to take control of my computer. I tried explaining one more time that the printer wasn't connected to the new router. He hung up on me. I chatted again (see photo), and the support person said she'd have someone call me but did not and canceled the chat. I called by the number and they answered and hung up on me again after putting me on hold. Then the next time I called back, they simply refused to answer the call. In addition to poor instructions, this is what you can expect from Lexmark,Moving back to HP, even at no charge, this is the most frustrating and expensive printer you'll ever own.Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a very advanced computer and network user, I owned a computer store for years.First the good.Once you get the printer set up and connected to the network the print quality is very good. The printer prints fast and even on standard copy paper does a very nice job of printing. It's also reasonably quiet which I enjoyed a lot.Copying on the printer is also relatively easy and works very well. I haven't tried the fax simply because I use an app to scan everything now and send it via email or hellosign.Now the not so good.First, the instructions are ridiculous. You get a about 7 pages of paper with no words, just photos and a CD. Honestly, who still has a CD drive on their computer? They need to either switch to a thumb drive or just tell you where to go to download manuals and let you know to do it online.The actual unboxing and setup itself is relatively straight forward, it's when you get to needing to type on the keypad that things start going south. Unless your fingers are the size of an infant's, it is very difficult to accurately type on the tiny touch keypad on the screen of the printer. It literally took me 11 tries to get the passwords to match because you can't see what you are typing, only dots.Connecting to the network took a few tries, again, because there are not clear instructions included nor onscreen instructions. Once I was connected, I needed to update my Apple computer to connect and that process was pretty painless.I downloaded their app and so far it is nearly useless. I can't print from Google docs and there are favorites I can theoretically add but haven't been able to get them to work yet.I would not recommend this printer to anyone who isn't at least moderately tech savvy, HP has them beat by a mile in terms of setup overall.Supplies for the printer seem to be generally in line with what I'd expect.I feel like the printer is somewhat overpriced for what you get, especially when you factor in the pain of setting it up.I feel like this will be a good printer that will last a while and definitely get the job done but unless things change a lot between now and my next printer purchase, I'll probably go back to HP.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QFFOJ62ANPQ8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,12,2,No,

The same with the copy feature, but that feature is great to have. However, scanning has been absolutely necessary in this age of the pandemic, and the speed of doing so is invaluable to me. The scan quality is excellent, and the software gives plenty of options for customizing my documents. My only issue was it took me a bit of time to download the app, but it was well worth it.I am extremely impressed with the speed of print for both black and color and the volume of pages for output.

R1120UPLV1XOIE,"April 16, 2020",Dr. Stuart Gitlow,5,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,Easy setup. Excellent single pass full duplex scanner. Crisp clear color output.,"Unpacking: A few sheets of setup illustrations, an AC cord, a CD-ROM which was unnecessary for my Mac based installation, and the printer. Easy enough for one person to handle and one of the lighter full color laser printers I've handled.Setup: Usual Lexmark ease. Run the Lexmark app on your smartphone, connect to the printer, and then set up the printer with your home wifi network. Everything worked immediately thereafter and I could check from my computer to see whether the paper bin is full and how much toner remains in each cartridge. I noted that there's a side door for easy access to the excess toner collection module.Operation: Running with a Mac Pro and System 10.15.4, everything works smoothly and correctly. Very reasonably quiet operation, quick first print time, bright crisp color, and incredibly pleased by the single-pass duplex scanning capability. This latter feature is often overlooked but definitely makes quick work of scanning double-sided material. Note that many products have only single-side capability, and some have double-pass duplex capability, meaning they have to scan one side, flip the sheet, scan the other side, then flip it again to discharge it in the correct orientation. That takes forever when you're scanning a pile. This scanner brings in both sides simultaneously - quick, easy, and so far I've had no problems with the feed mechanism.The color touchscreen works properly and can be set up through Preferences to display only the commands that you want readily available. There's a small feeder so that you can put envelopes in without having to reload the single paper tray. And best yet, in my mind, is that you put paper into the tray in the same orientation that you want it printed - that is, the print will appear upright on the same side of the paper that faces up. So you never have to think to yourself as you put in letterhead how to get the orientation correct. Wonderful, and one of very few printers where this is the case.Build quality is excellent.

I'm tired of the inks either running out quick or the missing spots of printing. This was easy to setup for the most part after taking all the shipping tape off the printer. I did all the installation through the lexmark app.This was great because the lcd screen is way too small. It is a touch screen but its too small for a 2020 printer. The touch screen does let you select copy, fax etc when needed. The top feeder is excellent and the scanner made great copies, nice and clear.Its little on the noisy side but once the print comes out the unit shuts down fast so its quick to print and quiet again.The inks are very easy to remove when needed. the front is a flap that drops down and the inks are in a drawer that you pull out. Very easy!Print quality is nice but the colors were running on the green side for me. I'm also not able to tweet any settings because i'm using a mac. The supplied software disc is only for windows. Their online download section does NOT have anything for this model for mac os x.So while you can print and use all the functions you cannot do any adjustments from what i can tell as of yet. Hopefully soon there will be a mac version which i'm sure will come soon.Printing can also be done via iPad/iphone too. just download the mobile printing app. Note...make sure your devices are on the same network wifi as the printer or it won't show up as an available printer choice.

RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,3,MB2236adw,Verified Purchase,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights"," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set.

Then in step 13 there is a picture of the CD and an arrow to a laptop. My laptop doesn’t have a CD drive. So I tried using it on a desktop Windows 10 PC and it couldn’t find the printer. I assume there was a missing step somewhere that was to allow the printer to access my local WiFi network. Since I have a wired ethernet as well as WiFi, I chose to make a wired connection so that I could go to the next step in the setup program. It did find the printer and that allowed me to go further. I did have to do a bit of troubleshooting to actually get it to print. I got some error message about something (SMTP?) not being set up. I kept trying to print and I thought it still wasn’t working until I went to the room where the printer was located and found that it had been printing and double sided at that. I seem to remember it asking me at some point if I used the wireless app to set up the printer. Since I didn’t have a wireless app that I was aware of, I said no.

RA4TT0RCQT8VK,"March 27, 2020",Robert J. Newell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast, Good Print Quality, Easy to Hook Up, But Where's the Toner?","Let's be clear, it's a good printer. It was easy to set up, has decent features, and the print quality is good.Setup: cabled setup is easy, although if you're not going to go wireless, you'll have to supply your own cable, whether USB or Ethernet. I won't dock them for that, although they could have said ""cable not supplied"" in their writeups. This just worked out of the box on my Linux system. For Windows, you should probably download drivers from the Lexmark support site. Not sure about Mac.Wireless setup is accomplished from the little display window on the printer. I've always found this annoying but if you run Windows and want to install their software you can avoid this. But there is nothing hard about it, just a little tedium, and it works as it should, although I always prefer the Ethernet option. (Tip: on your router, assign a fixed IP address to the printer. This makes life easier for non-USB connections.)Okay, how does it work? Just fine. Double sided printing is wonderful, print quality is great, speed is about what you'd expect today--- in other words, very good for a home printer used by a few people. (Don't expect to use this in a 20 person office, though.) It's a light-duty printer, very suitable for a home office.Build quality is good. Don't drop it off tall buildings, but don't be afraid to move it around or carry it around. It should stand up just fine.Now, the one gripe. Toner. It comes with the plague of printers in pretty much the last decade, the dreaded ""starter"" cartridge. This is a cartridge that is maybe 10% full, meaning you have to buy a real cartridge almost right away. And guess what, the cartridge price is in the same range as the printer price in most cases. Manufacturers don't have to make money on the printer, they make it on the cartridge.The ""starter"" is supposed to be good for 500 pages, about one ream. If that holds up, depending on your needs, you might get a week or two in a busy home office, and maybe a month or two of really casual use.So you better order that cartridge. You go to the Lexmark site and ... oh my, they aren't selling them. Maybe a little later on? Better hope so, or pretty soon you'll have a brick. This is 100% inexcusable. And comparing similar Lexmark printers, the cartridge will be over a hundred dollars. Wow.Usually there are 3rd-party cartridges, often for about 15% of the price. That's what I always buy for my other printers; I find a reputable vendor and buy from them. But you cannot get the cartridge for this printer anywhere at the time of this writing (late March 2020).I'm going to provisionally rate the printer four stars. After all, it's a very good product. I would have gone five if the cartridges were available at a fair price. I will revisit this later. If in a month or two you still can't get the cartridge, the rating will be one star.Followup in June 2020: Toner is now available from the manufacturer (pretty expensive) and from at least one third party (a little less expensive but still not cheap).",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4TT0RCQT8VK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,11,0,No,
R2E0YW6BHGAOSB,"March 23, 2020",JoeInTampa,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast print from cold start, easy to set up.  Clean print.  Needs documentation.","This is a very nice monochrome laser printer. One I had previously took a long time to print from a cold start. This one begins to print almost as quiickly as an inkjet printer. Print quality is excellent and print speed is high. Wireless setup was very quick and easy. I like Lexmark's Unison toner. It separates the toner cartridge and the imaging unit unlike other toner cartridges where the units are combined. The Unison toner cartridge doesn't need shaking to equalize printing and prints at lower temperature than previous types of toner, so that means lower energy costs as well as quicker printing from a cold start. My only issue is probably due to this being a new item that I received through the Amazon Vine program.

First of all, this was simple to set up, even for someone who is still running Windows 7 Pro. I did use the disk to get rolling on the drivers - and it seemed to be updated drivers. The printer runs pretty quiet and quick. The biggest concern you may have is replacement toner cartridges, which similar printers at Lexmark are well over $100, although I haven't seen any for sale anywhere as of yet - but since this is a new product, I'm pretty sure they will roll out when the printer goes public. I'm not sure if this cartridge can be refilled - some offices I've worked in have had refillable cartridges, but I'd have to investigate more to see if that is possible for this one.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2H23BTT4SYGAP?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,

RU29785I48QOO,"March 18, 2020",LifeIsGood,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Speedy monochrome for the small or home office,"This compact laser printer (8 3/4"" H x 14"" W x 14"" D) does just one thing, but it does it very well. From sleep to first page out is under 10 seconds and pages print at the advertised speed, even using the duplexer, which I love. The picture instructions are bad, and there is nothing else, but once you get the printer out of the box they kind of make sense. This does not come with any cables other than power, so if you want to connect other than wirelessly you will need an Ethernet cable to connect to your network or a printer cable (with that squarish connector) to connect to your computer. I opted for wireless as I wanted to test this with my Android tablet as well. Once you power on the printer you have to use the 2-line monochrome screen to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that if you connect to a network it has to be 2G and not 5G. The driver for this is not on the Lexmark site as of this review, so I had to use the CD (I tried with the Windows driver and the pages printed like a negative, but the Lexmark software fixed that). The Lexmark app installed fine on my Android tablet (Samsung) and I was able to print from there as well. This is a no-frills B&W laser, but it is the best one I've ever used.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU29785I48QOO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
RX72XBHQ26O0T,"March 16, 2020",Man in the Middle,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Very fast and works well. PC setup is easy. Mac setup is manual.,"The first thing I noticed on setting up this new printer is that it came with only one page of pictorial setup info, and no manual. It did include a driver CD, but my iMac running Catalina couldn't find any files it could run on that. In addition, searching the Lexmark website found no useful information about this new B3442dw model (though I did find a brochure about its likely predecessor, the B2442dw.)Fortunately, I was easily able to set the printer up properly anyway. Just remove all the packing materials both around the toner cartridge and on the outside of the case, load some paper, and power the printer on. A built-in small display will talk you through the needed initial settings, including entering a password to join your WiFi network. From there it was simple to tell my iMac to add a printer, and chose that one from the bonjour list that appeared. Once set up, its Options & Supplies button in the driver allows all other settings to be seen and customized easily.Since I do also have a Windows 10 laptop PC (Dell Inspiron XPS 15), I WAS quickly and easily able to install a driver on that, using the included CD.Once a driver was installed, printing on both the iMac and the Dell was a simple matter of choosing the Lexmark printer for a document. The result was blazingly fast (I've never seen such quick duplex printing before), and good quality.Overall, this is an excellent printer, lacking only a bit more attention to documentation to be fully ready for prime time on Macs in addition to Windows PCs.Update: Just discovered an interesting problem. For no obvious reason, the link to this printer at IP address 192.168.1.26 has also taken over the link to my Western Digital MyCloudEx2Ultra at IP address 192.168.1.2. Attempting to open a Web page at 192.168.1.2 shows the printer's web page, the same as if I'd opened the page at 192.168.1.26. And the MyCloud can't be accessed unless the printer is powered off. Those two addresses should NOT be in conflict, but somehow are. I'll update once I figure it out.Update 2: No toner is listed as available yet for this printer, either here at Amazon or at the maker's website. Whether the toner for the earlier model B2442dw would also work on this new model is unknown.

R2558N1P0X0T8S,"March 15, 2020",Eric L.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Full Featured Networkable Printer,"The printer does not seem to come with a USB cable. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one on hand or buy one. Or at least mine didn’t come with any cables other than power. That was ok for me because I am using Ethernet and I have a bunch of spare Ethernet cables, and there is also wireless connectivity available. But USB likely the easiest way to get up and running for non-techies, so if this is you, have a spare printer cable lying around, or purchase one with the printer. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one or buy one.Once unpacked and set up following the crude pictograms included, it was necessary to download the drivers and install them. The unit does come with a CD installer disk, but even if you have an antique computer with an optical drive, it makes more sense to go to the Lexmark website and download the latest drivers. Who knows how old the ones on the CD are?After plugging the printer into my switch using Ethernet, and running the installer, the software could not find the printer, nor was it listed by my router as being connected (though the Ethernet activity lights on the printer were flashing). Eventually, I noticed that the small LCD display on the top of the printer had some questions about time, date, and language that must be answered on the printer before it will even show up on the network. After completing the setup on the small LCD screen, the printer was connected but the installer still could not find it. Instructions would have been helpful here, especially for people who aren’t technically inclined, but you can probably find help online.It was necessary for me to go to my router’s web page, get the printer’s DHCP provided IP address, and plug that into the installer manually in the “advanced set up” area. Also, it asks for you to manually type in the port name. I typed in “Ethernet” (no quotes) and it worked, the installer was able to proceed. After doing this on my main computer, I went back to the router and assigned a fixed IP address to the printer so that I will have no trouble finding it when I install the driver on my laptop and other computers.The software itself is nice and compact. I have a Canon printer that came with software that’s all up in your face all the time… meaning, it came with a bunch of bloatware like scrapbooking apps and card making apps and a bunch of docks and control panels that I had to carefully remove after writing the review. In the case of this Lexmark, it’s all business and it’s not in your face at all, and I appreciate that.The printer is fast and quiet. Over Ethernet, when I send a page the printer, it’s done printing before I can even start wondering how long it will take. Coming from an inkjet printer, this is really nice. Also, the network connectivity is indispensable these days. It certainly is if you have two or more devices in your life that you’d like to print from. That network connectivity also makes it easy to tweak the settings as the printer publishes a web page that you can reach from any web browser (if connected to from your local network). Just type the IP address of the printer into your browser and the settings page comes up. By the way, this is another good reason to assign a static IP to the printer; you can then just add a bookmark to your browser. That administrative web page allows you to change many parameters in several categories. Some of the settings are beyond my paltry comprehension, but there is a lot there that is useful to me, and some of it I’m sure is useful to IT personnel deploying these things on larger networks. There are a lot of IT tweaks and settings available here.The printer is handsome looking and compact, and it feels durable and professional. I think it will be perfect for my home office. Every computer I have can now print quickly and quietly from anywhere in the house.The unit comes with a toner cartridge that is described as a “starter cartridge.” It’s not clear to me how many pages we will get out of this; also, at the time of writing this, I couldn’t find replacement cartridges on Amazon or on the Lexmark site. No doubt they will be rolling these out soon; I just hope it’s sooner than my “starter cartridge” lasts. When available, I expect the replacement cartridges to cost well north of $100 each.I remember when laser printers cost a couple thousand dollars each, and then you had to pay extra for network connectivity. The price of this one is very appealing. In fact, it seems like a steal at this price. Just don’t forget that they get you on the toner, same as inkjet makers get you on the ink. There’s still no free lunch.Other than that, I’m delighted with this little printer. It really is quite perfect for a small office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2558N1P0X0T8S?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R10V9WCIQS76AL,"March 14, 2020",Summit,1,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"FAST! Love it!  ***UPDATED: Didn't last through starter toner...  it's dead, Jim!","*********EDITED MAY 2020: It didn't make it through the tiny starter toner. It connects to the network, it just refuses to print with no indication why. I'm a retired network engineer and have dealt with the nastiest of printer problems on networks and repaired printers in the field with paperclips, soldering iron and sheer anger. This one stopped working rather early on and can only print it's own configuration- no other print jobs will work and nothing more of an error than it just ""can't print"" the job. My last Lexmark was an utter failure, too... and this one will now join it as I have to PAY to recycle them both. As of today, replacement toner is not available anywhere- even from Lexmark unless I mail in the empty one first to refill. I'm done with Lexmark after decades of buying dozens and dozens of their enterprise printers at a time.**************This is a no-frills, monochrome printer without all the fancy touch-screen nonsense. What it does, it does perfectly- spit out paper quickly.I print a LOT while I'm working on some business plans, consulting and getting my MBA just for giggles despite being retired. My color laser eats toner as if it is free and it most certainly isn't. Having a monochrome, fast, two-sided printer as a default is the best idea ever... save that color printing for when it's actually necessary. It's surprising how often one does NOT need color, and the cost savings of not wasting printing in color is significant.I set this up without looking at directions, as I always do. Initially, it didn't detect ANY WiFi networks in my house when there are actually five of them. This was odd, but after several tries it started to see them. I had to go through typing the password through the simple buttons and simple display three times, but it finally connected and all is well.There is an app for this as well as computer software, but I chose to do everything without adding yet another app or yet another bit of software on my computer. It's likely far easier to do it with the apps etc- so unless you're just a glutton for punishment like me, just use their app.When it came time to print, this is when I became a big fan... it spits paper like crazy! I set it to print a large document, four pages per side, double sided... and wow, it was racing through it so much faster than any other printer I've had. SUPER fast at getting prints done. The print quality is fantastic, too. Double-sided printing saves SO much paper and space, too.Lexmark has always been one of my favorite printer suppliers, mostly known for their commercial machines. My last Lexmark was a color laser which was a complete disaster and never worked well at all. It ended up being recycled without ever having a successful print. Lexmark has redeemed themselves with this one- it's a business class machine that will absolutely STUN you with how fast it can put out pages. The ads say 42 pages per minute... which is faster than what I got, but plausible.Bravo, Lexmark.

Monochrome","I originally got this for my kids to use -- school projects are going to bankrupt me -- but I've been so impressed that this has become my main default printer. It will print, copy, scan and fax. Setup was simple for me -- driver update and off we go . . . and I found that it did all the things it was supposed to easily. It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser. The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall). The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning. I miss that more than I thought I would. It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that. I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color. And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain. Two line scrolling menu to control the printer? SHEESH. Horribly cumbersome. BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again. Oh, and the smtp error. That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother. That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit. For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk.

RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,4,MB2236adw,Verified Purchase,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.","PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYUB0RC2X96PZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,6,1,No,

Though I think the set- up was relatively easy for me because I have a lot of experience with printers and electronic gadgets and may not be so easy for a newbie to set-up.I ordered this Laser printer because my old one does not as efficiently I would like (very slow). This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids.

Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular. I pay around 1/2 a cent for the ink for each page on my black and white Brother... although sometimes it isn't as nice and crispy as it should be.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R369M0HXD51CGA?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,1,0,No,
R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,MB2236adw,Vine Customer,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R267GU2ETRU9V7?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,5,0,No,

The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text). Since getting the printer, I have been using it by connecting the USB, as getting wireless printing to work every time is a chore.Without the other reviewer's comments, I would never have gotten rid of the error that reminds you to set up SMTP. Actually setting up SMTP has proved beyond my capabilities.The printer also takes a fair bit of time to start up, and it needs to be restarted quite often as its OS locks up if it's left alone.Overall, it's a good printer if you don't mind hooking up the usb every time you want to use it.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5XZE153QXCEF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,0,0,No,

I also have a higher resolution inkjet which I will keep on standby for photographic projects, but the Lexmark laser has now been assigned as my workhorse for label printing and creating crisp documents. The print quality is noticeably better when printing text only.I love that there is no extendable document tray to get in the way or to have to remember to pull out to prevent papers from dropping to the floor: printed documents are delivered neatly underneath the scanner bed.The printer initiates quickly after a job has been sent, almost instantaneously over wireless network or USB (both tested), and the printing is quick and efficient.The manual feed is easy to use and auto-selects when I tested with an envelope, with no prompt asking which feed or tray to choose from. There is also a handy icon at the manual feed next to the sliding size guide, so you'll never put your paper or envelopes in upside down or back to front.As expected, the scanner takes a little time to process at its maximum DPI of 600, but no more than the average scanner. The output is clean and good quality.The copier works well and also has a good quality output. Speed is average.The touchscreen user interface is easy to read and intuitive.This straightforward color laser printer perfectly suits my needs as I don't scan or copy handfuls of documents at a time. If you do, be sure to check out the version of this printer that has the automatic document feed (ADF) so you don't have to babysit the machine with manual input by constantly opening the scanner bed cover and switching or turning over documents.

The printer became unable to communicate with the computer and drivers had to be removed and reinstalled. This is the second time the printer has done this and I really don't use it much. I'm giving up on using it wirelessly and I'll use the cable from now on.###Easy, nearly effortless setup. I had the machine up and running in maybe 20 minutes including downloading and installing drivers and connecting to a wireless network. It was difficult to enter the wireless password accurately due to tiny ""keys"" on the touchscreen. Thankfully this is not the sort of task that needs doing very often. It includes a software CD but my current PC lacks a drive so I had to download it.No printer cable was included. The manual as such was a sheaf of loose papers with illustrations shwoing pretty much just how to take the packing tape off and a few pages of written cautions.Printing or copying proceeds quickly. Copying is no slower than a photocopier, though I haven't used one in awhile so they may have improved. Color copies come out washed out in light places and oversaturated in darker areas. Basically it doesn't handle contrast well when copying and I wasn't able to find an adjustment for that. Your color copies are going to look like copies, not like they came off a file. Black and white copies fared better.If you're looking for easy use, speed, convenience and competitive price, this could be the right printer for you. Just don't expect much of it as a color copier. I didn't test it by scanning, saving a file and printing. That would be one workaround that would allow a user to color/contrast correct scanned images before printing.The included toner cartridges are labeled as ""starter"" cartridges and presumably have less toner in them than replacements will. Lexmark has a trade-in program for recycling cartridges that will save you about $15 on each of the four. 1500 page replacement cartridges are as little as about $75 with the trade-in and as much as about $99 without, from Lexmark. The black toner model number is c3210k0 if you want to look into replacement costs.I did not test the double sided print function but assume it works.While it worked beautifully on initial wireless setup, the second time I used it to print ( I do not print often) it didn't work and I had to uninstall and reinstall the wireless software or driver.

I finally called Lexmark customer service, and was told I didn't need a print driver with a Mac or iPhone, that I could just use AirPrint, a utility I didn't know I had. The printer has worked seamlessly from two laptops and an iPhone. For reasons I didn't understand, though, I wasn't initially able to print from my first iPad on iOS v13.1.1, but after an update, I found the setting on the iPad, and was able to print without any difficulties.So, we unboxed it and got it all set up, and it works even more seamlessly than that. My husband, who printed from it before I did, and is using an older Mac system, High Sierra, was given the option to use AirPrint, and was able to print without any difficulties after giving the printer the network password. I just used Command-P, the standard Apple print command, got a print window, deselected the old printer, was given the option to use this printer (even though I'd never printed on it from this computer), and got a beautiful, double-sided printout with colour illustrations. The print quality is excellent, better than any from our previous printer, including the last, an inkjet which forgets it ever knew our network much more often than not. Printing from our ancient Chromebook, even for the first time, was just as easy. We've had no issues with the printer forgetting our network, so I'm sure it was the previous printer, not the network. All of the printouts have been perfect. Digital scanning has also worked very well, as does copying.This comes with starter toner cartridges which are intended to be recycled through Lexmark.

Just download the app, follow the 2 instructions, and you're done. Yup... that easy. I spent 3 hours trying to figure out what I needed to do next in order to set it up and the answer was: nothing. It's literally the best setup for a network printer I've ever seen.I've been using a Dell color laser for several years and it was time to upgrade. It was still a good printer, but with the increase in print quality that is now available, and reduction in size, it was time to upgrade. This Lexmark printer wasn't just an incremental upgrade, it was a giant step forward for print quality. I'm able to print photo quality prints on plain paper. (If I was doing a finished product I'd still use laser photo paper)It's fast, quiet, and works seamlessly with all of my computer, and mobile, applications.One thing to note that frustrated me a bit was the scanner. Now follow with me on this before you judge. I've tried multiple times to scan remotely from my PC and it simply won't work while the machine is in sleep mode. It's like the network won't recognize the scan function while it sleeps. Then, I thought about it for a second. Why would I scan something if I wasn't standing by the printer putting whatever I want to scan on the machine? So unless I missing something, it really isn't a big deal.I also can't seem to scan multiple pages into one document as the model I purchased doesn't have the sheet feeder. The windows scanner app doesn't allow it, which is a pain in the neck and not Lexmark's fault. Happily, the mobile app that Lexmark provides does allow for this functionality, so there is an easy workaround.I do wish I would have gotten the sheet feeder though, so if you scan multiple page documents, don't be silly like me and say, ""I don't need the sheet feeder,"" because you probably will.All in all, wonderful printer that I would highly recommend. 5-stars!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27BD0DH78KO5F?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,9,1,No,

I finally decided to go with this one because it seems all printers get bad reviews but this one didn't seem to be too bad. I received my first one very quickly and I was very excited. I opened it and saw that the scanning bed was cracked. So, back in the box it went. Mind you, this is a heavy machine and it's not easy to pack it up, etc. I requested a new one to be sent to me.The second machine took longer to get to me but I got it in about 3 days. I got it out of the box and got it set up. I connected it to my internet and thought things would be realitively each. No such luck. You have to down load an app to your phone to be able to print from your phone. I do a LOT of printing from my phone or Ipad. So, I down load the app and it can't find the printer even though they are on the same network. After getting the manual off of HP website and doing some searching, I realize it's because one of the settings is wrong. Sorry - I can't remember the setting now and I don't have the printer any longer. So, I set the indicator and it seems my phone sees the printer. Yea! So, I go to send a document to the printer. It's about a 10 page document. My current deskjet would hardly take any time to print this type of document. I waited and waited, etc.... The printer kept saying it was receiving the document but wasn't printing. After about 30 minutes, I decided to try to set up the software on my printer. Of course, in the middle of setting up the software, the printer decided to 'start' printing my document but only printed about a quarter of one page and that is all I ever saw it print.So, I decided to try to concentrate on getting my computer set up. Again, my deskjet was never an issue. Find the printer and start printing. I updated the software and tried to print a document again from my computer. I kept getting communication errors between my computer and the printer. The printer was online the whole time and so was my computer. Mind you this went on for a few hours one night and into the next day.When I finally think something is printing, it printed a small box and then I got a firmware error. So, I went to look for an update. Again, you have to connect thru your computer to the printer using the computer number. The printer was showing me the number but everytime I tried to access it, it would time out. I tried this for a few hours. This is the only way I could find in the manual to actually update the firmware on the printer, but since I could not get to the actual menu, I couldn't update it.By this time, I'm fed up. So, I decided in the end to just return the second machine also. Please keep in mind, that I work in IT. I'm not a hardware person, but I can figure out most things if I have instructions. I don't know how they expect anyone to get this working without support. Yes, I could have called for help and it might have been resolved, but I don't like to have to call for help. It should have been working or easily fixed when I connected.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ILGSJOL4M04X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,38,4,No,

R3JNRMNTBR74AC,"June 4, 2020",R. Eye,3,MC3224dwe,Vine Customer,Solid laser but expensive cartridges. Scanning difficulties.,"This Lexmark MC3224dwe multifunction printer/scanner/copier/fax is the version without an automatic document feeder for scanning/copying/faxing.There are numerous unpacking videos online as well as a user manual you just have to make sure you have the model ""dwe"" extension some videos address the automatic document feature version of this machine.The MC3224dwe does not come with a hard copy user manual but does come with illustrated unpacking instructions and a CD with software.The setup for manual wireless operation requires input of the network password on a tiny LCD screen without echoing the actual characters input. This makes for an excruciating experience without character visibility. Mobile app may be easier to use since cell phones have better keyboards.The option to scan from the MC3224 to a pc wirelessly disappeared from the LCD menu screen so I could only scan as a pull option from my PC. I think if I purchase a USB cable then maybe I could initiate scanning from the MC3224dwe LCD panel, but I am unwilling to invest in this wired cable since I need wireless capability.I was able to wirelessly produce test prints from my iPhone to the printer and it worked flawlessly. The print was of good quality it is not on par with my older Dell color laser printer.Joining the MC3224dwe to my Windows 10 laptop was no problem and I can print from windows. No fax test was attempted because I don't have a phone line near the printer.The toner cartridges must be Lexmark new or recycled and third party cartridges will not work. These cartridges are VERY expensive even with Lexmark's recycling program. Typically, replacing all 4 toner cartridges will almost cost as much as a new printer! This is a HUGE deal breaker for me since my Dell color laser cartridges are far less expensive and my Canon MFD black toner is a fraction of this cost.If you use a wired connection, then you may have better results setting up this device.

RTK9V316GMLB3,"July 31, 2019",Scott McElhiney,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,"Good quality, check out cost of replacement toner","This was super easy to setup, I followed the pictures in the instructions for removing all the tape strips etc... plugged it in and used the USB to my desktop. Didn't need that though as it also setup the wifi to my network via the keyboard (could have used a mobile app on my phone), with me just pushing the button on my cable router and it found it and made a secure connection in seconds. Probably the second thing I've ever had connect where I didn't have to go through punching in a long password with correct capital letters and is that a 1 or a i or an L? I printed a test page and it did it fast and very high quality. Then I took one of my photographic pieces of artwork and laid it in the scanner bed and copied it. The only dramatic difference I see between the professional print and the copy is due to using paper that is more like parchment so I have texture rather than a glossy print. I don't believe anyone would purchase this for printing artwork, but in a pinch it'll due without leaving a horribly colored print with lines.It's size is what one would expect from a modern all in one... this is substantial, but not an office printer for those collating hundreds of copies of large documents at a time. Only one drawer for paper, so changing paper type will involve removing and reloading with whatever you need.It does two sided duplex printing automatically, so you don't have to reload paper, that is a nice feature. And you can send stuff to this pretty much any way imaginable, wi-fi, usb, ethernet, including through a few apps from your Apple or Android products.It also still includes FAX capability, something I haven't tried out because I haven't had a landline in years. It can email scans to your devices which I suspect will get used a lot more than the FAX machine part, but if you are in a business that still sends or recieves faxes, just plug in and it asks for the business name and phone number to configure itself. If you run a small office, that has a land line, I know that people pay for that when they NEED to send something by fax, so a potential profit center.The only downside I see to this is the cost of supplies. If you buy the cartridges for 2500 color copies from Lexmark with their return program supplies, it's $99.99 per color cartridge and there are three of those. 3000 pages for the black cartridge and it's $96.99. Their website shows them all on backorder, so hopefully as this printer penetrates the market, the price of supplies drops and availability increases.Given the choice between brands, the only one in the modern market I do not like is the one that times out it's supplies and lacks good support... and that isn't this. I've had good luck with Lexmark products in the past and this looks like a contender, just compare cost of supplies before jumping in.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTK9V316GMLB3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,6,0,No,
R291OJN6PJCTIT,"September 18, 2019",J. Peplinski,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Powerful and heavy,"I got this for home use, but it's really somewhere between a home printer and an office printer. Typically most people don't use a laser printer at home because the replacement toner is so crazy expensive, but this isn't enough printer for a huge office either. Maybe a very small business, even a home business? It definitely yields very professional results.It took me a little while to get it set up, as I don't have a disc drive (it comes with an install disc, but for some of us that's not helpful). The enclosed instructions were not very helpful, and the on-board touchscreen wanted me to set it up for mobile using my phone, then did not provide the correct QR code or series of numbers for me to get it working. Finally I did a manual driver search using my computer's install-printer settings. Even that was a little more complex than usual because it wanted me to enter the printer's IP address manually; fortunately that number WAS on the little touchscreen, and after that it was smooth sailing.After the minor hiccups of setting it up, it worked fast and extremely well! I needed to print a full-color comic book page onto cardstock right away, and it spat it out in about 10 seconds looking absolutely perfect. I understand I'll run out of toner in about a week if I make that a habit, but it is nice to have that capability when I need it! So far it has printed very crisp, professional looking documents, and the full color prints have been absolutely flawless.It is a little larger than my inkjet (which admittedly is a big, multi-function inkjet) and it is A LOT HEAVIER. So be sure you have a good printer stand for it, because it needs it's own place. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone and everyone for home use, as it is a whole lot of printer for just the occasional job. But if you need excellent quality printing and are able to pay for supplies, this is a very solid model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R291OJN6PJCTIT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,0,0,No,
R1CNBRTS6Y639V,"September 16, 2019",Dave Cunningham,2,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Mediocre office printer,"The main reasons this Lexmark doesn't get high marks from me: the setup is not as quick and easy as other printers I've had, and the color printing is only mediocre. I sometimes print photos and images on blank DVD disks, and I love that my Canon printer can do that in a very high-quality way. This Lexmark, not so much. Also, it's considerably larger than my Canon.It does spit out pages fairly quickly, about one every 3 seconds, and if you just need black and white document copies, this is a good printer for that. It's really best suited for office work.Another downside is that the toner is quite expensive. I was hoping to find a generic toner that would be compatible, but apparently none such exists yet.

R2QGCPEHD3BGXH,"August 15, 2019",Dora Explorer,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Great printer for small business or a busy household,"I'll start by saying that we are using this printer at home.*PrintingThe printer starts up and prints very quickly, even from being fully asleep. Black and white print quality is very good. The text is very crisp and dark. Color printing is great for say printing web pages and colorful items such as that. For pictures it’s passable, but it’s not the kind of stuff you are going to print out and put into a picture frame. As long as you are printing on the front of the page only it spits the pages out very fast. If you do two sided it has to suck the page back into the printer which takes much longer. All printers that do duplex do this, so this is not specific to this printer though.We have had the printer be picky about the paper it picks up. There was one certain batch of paper (and we do not remember where it came from, sorry) that it had trouble picking up and jammed once and printed crooked on the rest. Everything else we have fed it has been fine.*ScanningThe scanning seems to be pretty good. The automatic document feeder is a very nice feature, and is something we considered essential – I’m too old to stand there and swap pages manually.Another nice thing about the scanner is that it functions on its own. Some lesser printers require software on a computer and the devices have to be connected and all that in order to scan things. This is a pain and never works well for me. With the Lexmark printer though, you can email the scan jobs and as long as you have the email server set up it requires no computer or additional setup.It’s not immediately obvious, but if you set up what the printer calls a shortcut, that’s basically the address book for the scanner. Also, this is 10x easier to set up if you go to the web page of the printer. It can be done from the front panel but typing on the keyboard is a little painful. Just go to the IP of the printer in your web browser and you can set that up much easier.*Software and DriversThere is also an app that helps you set up wireless and such for the printer. It wasn’t great but it got the job done, just follow the instructions.We have android phones and used the android print plugin. It has low ratings in the play store, but for us it worked well without any issues at all.The latest version of windows 10 found the printer but did not have a driver to print with. If you go to the Lexmark website and type in the printer name, there’s a small download that will install drivers and find the printer and everything seems to work OK.For a mac, I was a little concerned when there wasn’t any mac version of the printer driver to download at first. When I tried to add it anyway I realized that the printer speaks airprint/bonjour and the printer was immediately found and added with no drama whatsoever.*Aesthetics/Fit and finishThe printer is a decent sized one, it’s bigger than most consumer printers, but it’s not huge. It feels well built and does not feel cheap or flimsy.The screen is touch and works very well, with intuitive menus and plenty of options. When you are using the keyboard things get a little tedious, but it does work and works well enough to actually use.The paper tray holds a fair amount of paper, and a nice feature is the printer knows how much paper is in the tray and when you look at “supplies” under the printer driver or in the web page, it will give you a useful indicator of the amount of paper.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGCPEHD3BGXH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,5,1,No,

Laake,5,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Rather compact and very capable for the price,"The box that the unit shipped in was rather large, though when you remove the foam padding and consider that this is a color laser all in one with duplexing and a sheet feeder, it's rather compact. Setup starts with removing from the aforementioned foam, removing a large bag, and removing a bunch of tear away strips. Note there are pull tabs on all of the toner cartridges as well.Software setup can be completed via an app on your phone, but not if you're rocking the ethernet (which I prefer). Web download of the latest drive is a bit of a pain, as Lexmark uses the whole separate support page vs sales page strategy. The latter comes up first in any searches, but clicking support dumps you at the main support page. Boo! Once you find the software/drivers, it's also a bit of a miss, as I needed to specify my OS and 32/64 bitness, which is very 2009, and not 2019.That aside, the software installed easily, and it defaulted to not sending info back to lexmark--kudos! This thing prints crazy fast--go back to the last sentence and read this thing prints, and that's how long it took to do a full color portrait. Granted this isn't a photo printer, but it'll meet every need short of that expectation. My last home color laser was an OG four pass model, so this is such a revelation! The quality of print is also equal to the task.I don't do a lot of scanning, but it does a solid job, and the feeder is greatly appreciated (the limited scanning I do tends to be multipages documents I've signed). I haven't (and won't) use the fax. Copies are quite snappy!All in all, I love this printer. So much nicer than any inkjet! Toner doesn't bleed, and it's so fast.

If you want to do anything else, like scan as a PDF, don't bother. The settings can not be changed from default, so the only option is to scan as either JPG or TIFF [Welcome back to 2005]. There is no software that installs with the printer making any setup that much harder. The instructions are non-existent, even if you can find something online. If you need functionality that should be common on any printer still on the market, skip this one and go with something newer. Shame on the vendor for not posting the age of the printer, which I found out later was last manufactured in 2015.Note: I called Lexmark tech support to attempt to get the scan setup working, and 1 hour later they still had no clue and gave up.

R8G8VXYIKS23K,"July 31, 2019",Dice,4,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,Quality and Feature Packed,"This printer is replacing an inkjet in a small home office that primarily prints word documents and the rare color image. This Lexmark has so far fit the bill well with it compact size, quiet operation, and fast printing capability. There are many features packed into this printer, all of which is controlled on the almost over-sensitive touch screen (perhaps my fingers are just too big). Setup was fairly straightforward for me and I didn't need any assistance. Wired and wireless connections work very well and I have had zero problems with wireless connections.Print quality is excellent for text, and so-so for images. However, if you are looking to print quality images, that is where an inkjet will still be handy. For that reason, my old inkjet will stick around strictly for printing images.Lexmark also offers an exchange program for their toner cartridges, saving the consumer about 25%. You purchase a toner cartridge from Lexmark, in exchange for your old one. However, it appears that of the time of this review, it is currently unavailable.Overall, for a home, or even office, this is an excellent printer. Even if you don't print often at all, but need the printer to work at the snap of your fingers, I would suggest this laser printer over an inkjet because unlike ink, toner won't dry out and become waste. You will pay the price upfront, but over the life of the printer, you will more than make up for the cost in the long run.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8G8VXYIKS23K?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,1,0,No,

They are not extremely heavy printers but tend to also need to do some occasional scanning, were interested in the idea of being able to fax medical paperwork when they can't upload in an app, and liked the idea of not having to replace ink continually. So we're in business with this printer.Hardware: Very well constructed, more durably made than your average HP or Canon these days.Packing: Very well packed in materials that did not get damaged nor have issues during shipping.Unpacking: Very easy to slide out of the box, no acrobatics requiredSetup: Setup is very easy. I used the menu rather than an app or installing things on a computerAfter setup and installing the local drivers and configuring them, the printer is very responsive for printing even though its allowed to sleep most of the time. It also works well with AirPrint which is fantastic!The LCD screen is bright, color, and easy to use. The touch buttons are also very easy to use. The functionality of the scanner, toner loading, other physical functions are easy. Double side printing is very easy.This was almost a 5 star review but there were a couple software issues that got in the way and I'm sure will be resolved with software updates.1. When setting up the fax, no matter how many times I named the fax, it wouldn't save. I had to skip it and do it later by navigating the menu.2. The printer for some reason came thinking it's main paper tray was ""colored paper"" which caused every single computer I set up to cause the printer to throw an error every time they tried to print to ""plain paper"" which is the default for every printer in the world forever and always for it's main paper tray-- I'd guess this was a setup bug/error.3. I cannot for the life of me get the software and driver for Windows 10 to recognize this model of printer to display a scanning utility. I'm expecting this to be solved by a software update as well. I know this printer was listed as ""just announced"" on the web site. The driver installs fine, I can print fine, but when I open the utility for scanning it says no compatible models found. Even Windows 10 recognizes the scanning device but...So summary: The printer is fantastic, I love it, I wouldn't hesitate on buying but only if scanning over the network is absolutely essential, and I'd guess that should be solved soon.

R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,4,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,53,1,No,

R2S19CBIJT7PAR,"September 6, 2019",S,5,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,"Solid, well-made printer","I got this Lexmark after my last printer died on me, and I’m pretty glad I did. It’s really well made, offers a ton of great features, and looks pretty good on my desk. While my needs for this printer aren’t many (I have another printer for my home office), it’s worked really well for me so far and I’d be happy to recommend it.Pros:When printing the black text shows up crisp and clear on the page, proving immediately that it’s a quality piece of equipment. It’s bold and punchy, and I haven’t had any trouble reading anything I’ve printed yet. The color printing for photos and images is pretty good, though I’ve seen much better from other printers. It’ll work just fine as long as printing color isn’t your main objective. After setup, the printer easily connects to my devices (Macbook, Android) without fail, and I’ve absolutely never had a problem.I love that the printer is so quiet - it doesn’t even wake my sleeping pets when they’re in the same room! The scanning feature is pretty easy to use and self explanatory with a regular speed. The small touchscreen is easy to use and lends a modern feel to the machine. Everything on the machine is high quality, and it feels like it’s made to last. Nothing flimsy whatsoever.Cons:As mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t recommend this printer if photos and color-use are your main objectives. While the printer works fine for these things, the vibrance is notably less than for my previous printer (Epson Workforce Pro WF-4630). This feels nitpicky, but I’d really have expected a larger paper tray from a printer of this size and price.Setup took a little longer than I’d prefer - you have to install a driver and painstakingly connect the printer to all your devices. Again, once setup, you’re good to go, but know that you’ll be sitting down for a good half hour or so to get it all working. For home use, I find the printer size a bit much. It appears to me a little smaller in the photos, so I was surprised when it arrived and I had to find a bigger spot for it.Overall, though, it’s a pretty good product.

RGN6CJJRKWO81,"August 6, 2019",Matthew R,5,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,Color printer/photocopier.  600dpi with photo enhancement.  Wireless capable and fast.,"This is a nice compact color printer. It also allows you to scan, fax and copy. The printer can copy/scan/print in 600dpi but if you use the photo settings you can get results that look better than 600dpi. It will not produce the results you would expect from a photo printer but it can produce nice quality output if you use the right settings.The touch screen is also in color and is bright and clear. (you can see it at an angle easily as well) It is nice to scroll through the menus like you would on your smartphone. (touch and drag)The scanner seems to make images a little brighter and a more 'washed out' than the original in some cases. The software comes with a TWAIN-compliant driver that will let you import images into your favorite graphics manipulation program. (like Photoshop for example) I was able to scan photos with close to photo-quality output by selecting the Photo Mode from the menu of the TWIAN driver and changing the dpi setting to 600. The image looked better than 600dpi but it did scan in 600dpi. The full 8.5x11 sheet was 5100 x 6600 pixels. (if you divide the pixels by 600 it ends up being 8.5 x 11)For office or home use, it is a great little printer as long as you aren't expecting it to print photo quality. One nice thing about a laser printer is that it can sit of years without issues, unlike an inkjet where the ink can dry and cause issues if it is not used frequently.The printer was easy to install and comes with an actual CD/DVD. (you can find the driver on Epson's website very easily if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer) It can also be set up to print from a phone over WiFi. My experience with printing from a phone is that it is a last resort since the phone itself limits the control you have over the print output.In summary, the printer only prints in 600dpi but some kind of enhancement is going on that makes photos look better than 600dpi when it is used. Even with those settings, it does not with photo quality results. For graphics, text and even photo-like quality, it is a great all-around multifunction.The printer goes to sleep on its own after a bit so to use it wirelessly you may need to power it on. It can be used as a scanner though it can only scan at 600dpi. (photo mode enhances the image for photos) I haven't tried the fax functionality since I do not fax much. The copier functionality is slick. You can navigate through the menus to get the optimal settings.It does everything I would expect it to do. The photo enhancements from photo mode produced very nice results for 600dpi, even though the output is not photo quality.

One day when I saw a huge discount on 3224awde I just make a purchase blindly and I am glad that I have invested in right thing. Here are some of the pros & cons about this printer.Pros:1. Print quality is best in this class of printer. I have compared it with HP 479fdw and color prints from hp doesn’t even come close to quality of lexmark.2. Color touchscreen provides great advantage of more controlled printing experience.3. Network connectivity and ease of access from ios or android device comes handy during the times when you are on phone and want to print something immediately without starting your laptop.4. It works great with mac.Cons:1. It is super heavy. If you are not taking proper precautions while moving it from one place to another you might break your back or damage printer badly.2. It performs poor with windows and thats why it has been notorious when it comes to reviews. I had to cancel my print jobs many times on windows but small tweaks or a restart resolves the issue.Final thoughts:If you are windows lover and love ease of access you might probably hate some of the complex troubleshooting other Operating Systems involved.

I won’t be happy when it costs $200 to replace all 4 cartridges, but hopefully I only have to replace the black once a year.

One was a toner printer and the other an inkjet. In comparison, this laser printer is much faster and prints a higher quality image. Also, the color quality is far more consistent than with my ink jet. Its size is similar to the other two but this is far heavier. My postal service carrier had to get my husband to carry it for her. It is also much noiser than the other two, by a lot! Setup took me about 30 minutes. It was not plug-n-play by any means. I am not computer savvy so this may be easier for other people. My network found the printer immediately however, it said the driver was not working. My computer showed the correct driver was installed but would not connect the two. I tried downloading the driver from Lexmark's website but could not find one comparable with windows 10. Eventually, I used the set up disk included with the printer and it worked. Inconvinent if, like me, your computer does not have a disc drive.For my phone, I had to download the lexmark app for it connect to the printer. I'm not sure if there is a way to use it from my android without the app; this was simply the easiest way I could find to get it up and running. It does require the print jobs to pass over other networks on the way to the printer. Not the most effective or secure way to print.Update: the printer is constantly coming offline. I called customer support about the issue. Explaining that I was trying to print from my smartphone, customer support said they needed access to my laptop to diagnose the problem. After screen sharing, he opened the admin log reports for my entire computer and said the issue was with the error reports I had not addressed. Mind you, these reports were for my computer, not the printer and included things like a crash report for my office software. Customer support then said the only way to fix the printer was for me to pay one of their techs to fix the log report on my computer. What?! What is customer support for if they don't trouble shoot AND help fix the issue? The gentleman was rude in his reply and told me if I didn't want to pay that was my decision. Then he hung up.

This replacement printer is FASTER, SMALLER, and QUIETER than what it's replacing-- which was an HP CP2025.It was very well boxed for shipping, unpacked easily, was not damaged in shipping and nothing had moved around.Unpacking is easy. It slid out easily and the protective materials over the toners was easier to remove than most printers. The tape was minimal and I was on my way in no time.Setup was a breeze. It asks several questions when you turn it on to set date, time, location and to clarify whether you want to set it up with a mobile phone app or not. Easy.Windows recognized it easily as did my iPhone (AirPrint compatible!) and I didn't need to break into the book included, nor the CD that came with the driver. It couldn't have been more painless to unbox and install.Using it is also a breeze. It's much quieter than my former HP when idling, goes to sleep and wakes up faster and does the job without any paper jamming nor complaints.The only part that has taken a tiny bit of getting used to has been the single paper tray. part used for things like labels or envelopes. It works very well. It prints on thicker media very fast compared to my HP, but I do miss a bit of a wing to prop up heavier, floppier or thicker singles of paper. They never fall out and the printer seems to grip on them right way, so there is no deficiency here, just difference.The thing is super attractive to look at, does everything I need it to with expediency, and while it's a full 10 years more youthful than my HP, it seems to be better built.The place where I work uses Lexmark for their most challenging, difficult environments and for the most complex print jobs like GLM printing, and they hold up.

They are nearly reliable (except when they break, run out of ink, mysteriously stop responding to commands like ""PRINT""...etc.) and slow and steady. Did I mention slow?So I was pretty thrilled to installer this Lexmark Color Laser Printer. A million years ago, when laser printers first came out (and my pet dinosaur roamed the earth), I remember how clean and crisp the printing appeared on the page . Only large institutions could afford laser printers way back then. Now ordinary mortals can.Now: the printer was easy to install. There's a cool little pamphlet with pictures detailing the instructions--no words! If you can follow the pictures, you're all set. The pictures even tell you what's recyclable. Awesome. However, there's a bar-code scanner for your phone to register the printer--decided to register the printer by phone on the spur of the moment. And some of the choices were a bit fuzzy; it asked for country and there was no place to CHOOSE my country. Things like that. More about the phone app in a second.Once the printer was installed, the Lexmark was MAGICAL. It printed in seconds flat. It took three seconds to print a full color print--crisp, beautiful. The printing for a full page was clean, no bleeding from the edges, and all the words were black and fine. The speed was astounding.However, the android app was really needs improvement. Some people do tons of printing from their phones nowadays, and if you do, you may have a problem with this app. First of all, the photos didn't print in color from my phone. They all printed in black-and-white. Lovely black-and-white, but they ARE color photos. Also, I can't print document from phone (only photo, camera, web page or clipboard). It would be great to be able to print a PDF or Word doc., for example, but it does not seem possible from the phone app. Granted, I did not try to troubleshoot at all. But I would really prefer that these kinks had been worked out before putting the app out to the public, because I'd like to have these capabilities at my fingertips immediately.The printer itself is terrific. I love it--it's fast and the printing is gorgeous. However, the app needs some work.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3758P32NJSX0K?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,8,0,No,
R3D3NT5A6EC7XQ,"July 18, 2019",Rock Edge,5,C3326dw,Vine Customer,"Beefy, reliable laser printer."," The Lexmark C3326dw arrived in an Amazon box just slightly larger than the manufacture box. 4 pieces of tape, a protected cartridge liner removal and easy pull away cartridge setup tabs later, I was ready to plug it in.To load paper, pull the entire tray out and load from back (it has a slight slant), holds about half a ream of paper.You can go wireless, with a network cable or USB (neither included). For this unit I’m going Wi-Fi.Power on asks if you want to set up via a mobile device, which directs you to the Lexmark Mobile Assistant app on your phone (I had to go install it). Using that app, you set up via Wi-Fi direct by finding the printer in your Wi-Fi connections and connecting (temporarily) to it.It will then search for wireless networks. It quickly found my 2.4 GHz network (not my 5 GHz). Typed in my password and we were done.If you can get the app to work, trust me, you’ll be happy. The manual ‘set it up from the console’ only has left and right arrows with an OK button to advance the letter system. So typing in any kind of lengthy or difficult password will take a hot minute!Clicking the power button puts it in a kind of sleep mode and to power it off completely hold the power button down for about 5 seconds.Once the printer was fully configured, I did a power on time test. From completely turned off, a click of the power button to ‘status ready’ took 53 seconds in Wi-Fi mode. I tested when configured via network cable and exactly the same time.Next up: the PC install. I tried to find ‘just the driver’ on the cd but the Lexmark installer is pretty much going to have to run on your local system (the web site had a more current version to download). I was thankful that at the end of the install process was a separate ‘utility’ installer for a system tray application to keep you aware of print job status, ink levels and other standard tray alerts. Thank you for not forcing it on us! But, it’s there if you like that sort of thing.The first thing I printed? My notes for this review! It was fast, I didn’t time it and only a few lines.The second thing was the image of the printer on the product page. I started the stop watch once I saw the communication light stop blinking, which is when you hear the printer spin up. Semi color page took 8 seconds.Two page document with both sides printing, 15 seconds. Same doc two pages: 10 seconds. 20 page single document B&W and Color both clocked in around 50 seconds. The attached vid shows the pace of a print jobs and the method of double-sided printing.Next I printed a color seating chart of Sun Trust field. Clicking print to finish was 15 seconds. 5 seconds communications and just under 10 seconds later it was in the tray.The printer comes with toner of course and the cartridges are going to yield approximately 500 pages for each of the Color cartridges and up to 750 pages for the Black print cartridge. Each cartridge has a model number for the ‘return’ version service and new version model numbers of standard yield and high yield. As of this posting, prices are not available on the site.Overall this was an easy to set up laser printer that is perfect for a small business or home office, could service a larger set of users easily and prints a quality sheet relatively fast.

RJI0VX8V39ZGZ,"July 31, 2019",Summit,1,C3326dw,Vine Customer,Built like a tank & fast,"I'm no stranger to laser printers- I worked my way through the I.T. industry, starting as the 'computer guy' who would come to your office to make your computers function- often elbows deep in a laser printer. Lexmark was originally a part of IBM and was separated in 1991 to be its own thing, but IBM is the go-to company for business class machines- it's even part of their name. The Lexmark printers are well known to business computing people, but probably less known to people who don't work in the computer biz and home users. Their products tend to be built to take a beating and this printer is no exception.One thing that stood out was the steel frame. It's a heavy, industrial quality machine. There isn't any ""fluff"" on it like many printers have- like touch screens and stylistic design. It's simple. The toner tray is unique and the paper tray is more simple than many- but that simplicity makes it durable. The tray latches in with a confident feel. By comparison, my HP color laser has a loose fitting, sloppy paper tray.I don't want more apps on my phone, so I configured this using the super simple little screen and buttons. The longest part was entering the password for the 2.4G network (it isn't compatible with the 5G network, boo...) but despite the simple buttons, it didn't take long as it quickly scrolls through letters and numbers. It connected instantly. I installed the whole software and driver package from the web site and noticed there is a new firmware upgrade as of a couple weeks ago- so I will apply that soon. The web site linked to the icon Lexmark places in their Windows software doesn't work. In fact, I can only bring up the printer settings when printing something- the printer control panel doesn't work any other way. One can also directly connect to the printer's web interface by simply putting the printer IP in a browser window. This is also how one updates the firmware once downloaded.Now, here's where things went a little strange. The printing I get is VERY fast and black and white prints are crisp. It defaults to printing both sides, which is annoying so I have to change settings. Color prints on mine are terrible, but since nobody else is reporting this problem I'm guessing it's because the delivery person tossed this in my driveway. I heard it hit the ground from inside the house. Packaging was minimal- the inside box has the molded foam around the printer but there was no padding between that box and the shipping box. I'll be looking into the problem more after the firmware update but the blue cartridge may be the issue. Printing various solid colors, the blue is extremely blotchy although no sign of toner leakage or damage to the cartridge. Until that is resolved, the color printing on this is extremely poor. Despite the color issue, the grainy appearance when printing a photo quality source is not nearly as good as my 6 year old HP color laser. For now, I'm only taking a star off for the wonky interface and the lousy software. Lexmark has always had wonky interfaces, but they make awesome business class printers. The printing issue on mine appears to be an anomaly and I'll update as I look to resolve it.*** update. all printing is blotchy to the point I can't even use the prints for draft working copies. I've gone through everything possible to attempt to resolve it to no avail. Not looking forward to having to deal with warranty and tech support- but I'll go through all that when I can find extra time to kill.****Second update. After trying a few basic things to try to reset the printer, it has failed to the point where it is now just a waste of space in my house. Warranty? Good luck with that. It was probably damaged when the USPS delivery involved throwing it in my driveway. Dropping off at the recycling depot today where I'll have to PAY to get rid of it.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJI0VX8V39ZGZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,15,1,No,

To keep my last printer going (kind of - with murky prints) I had to replace a maintenance box twice, so the costs were adding up.At the time of writing this, it looks like there is a black toner cartridge return program that costs $85 for the black toner, making the black replacement a little less than 1/2 the cost of the printer itself - so it might just be cheaper to purchase an all-new printer when this one runs out of toner, or at least two colors.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYR0ZINX0GTL0?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,0,0,No,
R3PX6BZ14XLM2W,"November 19, 2019",Many Words,5,C3326dw,Verified Purchase,A little bit longer than advertised - but excellent machine,"Just got the printer on line - which was simple enough although the documentation is Windows oriented - Mac set up was just follow the menu items on the printer screen and when complete - it just worked. Love the color, clarity, and ease of changing the cartridges. This is the best design... just pull open a drawer from the front, and they are laying in there in order. Lift and replace. No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem. The printer has a noise level when printing (and did quiet when not) however, its not much different from the Brother laser printer it replaced and is less noisy than an ink jet. For its price point and functionality - it is no problem.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PX6BZ14XLM2W?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,10,0,No,
RSP4J3G9KUG9G,"November 4, 2019",E. Weber,3,C3326dw,Vine Customer,Loud and blotchy,This is a fairly affordable laser color printer (the replacement cartridges look expensive).The installation was relatively easy and I didn't hit any particular issues. I started with wired network but settled with WiFi network connectivity which was also easy to setup.The printing speed is really good but the printer is very noisy.I also found that the print quality is not as crips are my black and white laser printer for simple documents. The letters look a little blotchier that I would want. I probably will only use this printer to print pictures.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSP4J3G9KUG9G?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,1,0,No,
R28BZQY1LG9EMK,"October 6, 2019",Julia Duke,4,C3326dw,Verified Purchase,A great purchase worth the money.,This printer is awesome. I was concerned about switching from an inkjet to a laser and I'm so happy I did. The print quality is amazing. Everything is so crisp and clear compared to my inkjet. The only thing I wish I could do is print pictures. I mean I can print them on 8x10 but cannot print anything smaller. This printer is also really heavy which is good and bad. Makes it very difficult to move but also means its heavy duty well made. I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good laser.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28BZQY1LG9EMK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,15,0,No,

It was fast and reliable and while it was very loud when printing, it was silent at all other times. After 5 months of light usage it started printing repeated fat lines of black, magenta, blue, and yellow on every page. It looks more like printing than toner smearing. I tried to contact customer support but there are a lot of roadblocks to getting to an actual person and I don't have time to step through all the hoops so I'm writing it off and buying another brand.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2O8X35XHSOT92?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,10,1,No,
