R16KJZQTOTLVJC,"July 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,1,MC3326adwe,Verified Purchase,toner costs more than the printer,"I print a lot, and I knew that I would be changing out an ink cartridge every week at the rate I print. I wanted a color printer since I do print documents and articles with color prints and images. Instead of an inkjet I decided to buy this laser printer, anticipating it would be cheaper in the long run than inkjet. I was wrong. After the 2nd week of having it I ran out of black toner which the printer informed me was low. I ordered the toner ($90 by the way), you have to order it since it is not sold in stores, (tried staples, best buy, office max, walmart, target, costco, etc). After the toner arrived I installed it and tried to print but it would not print since now the color toners were out. It did not mention that. I thought ok, I will only print in black and white or grayscale until I can get the color toner replaced. NOPE it will not print if any toner is out. I look up the color toner to purchase and it cost $100 MORE than the printer cost!!! I should have looked at that before buying the printer but I did not expect it to be so expensive. It is now a VERY expensive paperweight, as I refuse to pay more for my toner than for my printer. I ended up buying an inkjet, and although I will probably spend more money in the long run, I live paycheck to paycheck, I can purchase a $30 ink cartridge here and there, I can not drop $350 all at one time for toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KJZQTOTLVJC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,3,0,No,

Probably a good two reams of paper and we've been satisfied with it all.It is an incredibly quick printer and scanner. The print quality is great and the ink never bleeds. I've enjoyed using this printer with my crafts, specifically my waterslide decals, because the laser ink doesn't need to be sealed and doesn't bleed under moisture. It dries quickly and applies precisely.Scanning setup took a bit more effort for me (husband wasn't home) but I got it up and running just fine by myself. The menu is color and so far has worked well, I have no problem operating this printer at all. My multiple devices have paired with it great.As far as laser printers go, and this one also being a color printer, this is an excellent choice for a home or small business printer!

Those days are long gone and I don't miss them. I plugged this in. Connected it to my wife's tablet. It worked. Heck, before we did that, I had to run a copy of something real quick. I had already plugged it in, so I just hit the copy button after feeding what we needed into the right slot. That worked.So, yeah, there's more to it than that. We set up the printer on the WIFI at home. I used the interface directly on the printer. It was easy, quick and intuitive. I had no more finished when my machine beeped. It had recognized the printer and had already negotiated my machine to have access to it.The only work involved was getting the scanning software set up on my wife's machine and then getting her to act as the scan recipient (my machine had assumed that job). It was maybe, five minutes, max.The quality of the prints are good. The noise factor is low. The speed is adequate for a small family and a work-out-of-the-house business. Scans are accurate.

In terms of the setup, it's not too difficult to setup just standard printing and copying. However, the scanning feature is a joke. You can scan to e-mail or scan to a USB. I did not find anywhere that would allow you to scan to your PC, the most basic functionality that would make scanning make sense. The document feeder works fine and wireless was easy to set up.This unit is quite heavy. The printing is decently fast but I've only used it for printing black and white so far.

If you want to do anything else, like scan as a PDF, don't bother. The settings can not be changed from default, so the only option is to scan as either JPG or TIFF [Welcome back to 2005]. There is no software that installs with the printer making any setup that much harder. The instructions are non-existent, even if you can find something online. If you need functionality that should be common on any printer still on the market, skip this one and go with something newer. Shame on the vendor for not posting the age of the printer, which I found out later was last manufactured in 2015.Note: I called Lexmark tech support to attempt to get the scan setup working, and 1 hour later they still had no clue and gave up.

RTK9V316GMLB3,"July 31, 2019",Scott McElhiney,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,"Good quality, check out cost of replacement toner","This was super easy to setup, I followed the pictures in the instructions for removing all the tape strips etc... plugged it in and used the USB to my desktop. Didn't need that though as it also setup the wifi to my network via the keyboard (could have used a mobile app on my phone), with me just pushing the button on my cable router and it found it and made a secure connection in seconds. Probably the second thing I've ever had connect where I didn't have to go through punching in a long password with correct capital letters and is that a 1 or a i or an L? I printed a test page and it did it fast and very high quality. Then I took one of my photographic pieces of artwork and laid it in the scanner bed and copied it. The only dramatic difference I see between the professional print and the copy is due to using paper that is more like parchment so I have texture rather than a glossy print. I don't believe anyone would purchase this for printing artwork, but in a pinch it'll due without leaving a horribly colored print with lines.It's size is what one would expect from a modern all in one... this is substantial, but not an office printer for those collating hundreds of copies of large documents at a time. Only one drawer for paper, so changing paper type will involve removing and reloading with whatever you need.It does two sided duplex printing automatically, so you don't have to reload paper, that is a nice feature. And you can send stuff to this pretty much any way imaginable, wi-fi, usb, ethernet, including through a few apps from your Apple or Android products.It also still includes FAX capability, something I haven't tried out because I haven't had a landline in years. It can email scans to your devices which I suspect will get used a lot more than the FAX machine part, but if you are in a business that still sends or recieves faxes, just plug in and it asks for the business name and phone number to configure itself. If you run a small office, that has a land line, I know that people pay for that when they NEED to send something by fax, so a potential profit center.The only downside I see to this is the cost of supplies. If you buy the cartridges for 2500 color copies from Lexmark with their return program supplies, it's $99.99 per color cartridge and there are three of those. 3000 pages for the black cartridge and it's $96.99. Their website shows them all on backorder, so hopefully as this printer penetrates the market, the price of supplies drops and availability increases.Given the choice between brands, the only one in the modern market I do not like is the one that times out it's supplies and lacks good support... and that isn't this. I've had good luck with Lexmark products in the past and this looks like a contender, just compare cost of supplies before jumping in.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTK9V316GMLB3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,6,0,No,
R291OJN6PJCTIT,"September 18, 2019",J. Peplinski,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Powerful and heavy,"I got this for home use, but it's really somewhere between a home printer and an office printer. Typically most people don't use a laser printer at home because the replacement toner is so crazy expensive, but this isn't enough printer for a huge office either. Maybe a very small business, even a home business? It definitely yields very professional results.It took me a little while to get it set up, as I don't have a disc drive (it comes with an install disc, but for some of us that's not helpful). The enclosed instructions were not very helpful, and the on-board touchscreen wanted me to set it up for mobile using my phone, then did not provide the correct QR code or series of numbers for me to get it working. Finally I did a manual driver search using my computer's install-printer settings. Even that was a little more complex than usual because it wanted me to enter the printer's IP address manually; fortunately that number WAS on the little touchscreen, and after that it was smooth sailing.After the minor hiccups of setting it up, it worked fast and extremely well! I needed to print a full-color comic book page onto cardstock right away, and it spat it out in about 10 seconds looking absolutely perfect. I understand I'll run out of toner in about a week if I make that a habit, but it is nice to have that capability when I need it! So far it has printed very crisp, professional looking documents, and the full color prints have been absolutely flawless.It is a little larger than my inkjet (which admittedly is a big, multi-function inkjet) and it is A LOT HEAVIER. So be sure you have a good printer stand for it, because it needs it's own place. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone and everyone for home use, as it is a whole lot of printer for just the occasional job. But if you need excellent quality printing and are able to pay for supplies, this is a very solid model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R291OJN6PJCTIT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,0,0,No,
R1CNBRTS6Y639V,"September 16, 2019",Dave Cunningham,2,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Mediocre office printer,"The main reasons this Lexmark doesn't get high marks from me: the setup is not as quick and easy as other printers I've had, and the color printing is only mediocre. I sometimes print photos and images on blank DVD disks, and I love that my Canon printer can do that in a very high-quality way. This Lexmark, not so much. Also, it's considerably larger than my Canon.It does spit out pages fairly quickly, about one every 3 seconds, and if you just need black and white document copies, this is a good printer for that. It's really best suited for office work.Another downside is that the toner is quite expensive. I was hoping to find a generic toner that would be compatible, but apparently none such exists yet. I know people who much prefer laser printers to inkjet, and perhaps it will last longer than my Canon inkjet printer -- I have gone through three inkjets in the last eight years -- but I still prefer the nice quality color printing of an inkjet.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CNBRTS6Y639V?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,0,0,No,

R2QGCPEHD3BGXH,"August 15, 2019",Dora Explorer,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Great printer for small business or a busy household,"I'll start by saying that we are using this printer at home.*PrintingThe printer starts up and prints very quickly, even from being fully asleep. Black and white print quality is very good. The text is very crisp and dark. Color printing is great for say printing web pages and colorful items such as that. For pictures it’s passable, but it’s not the kind of stuff you are going to print out and put into a picture frame. As long as you are printing on the front of the page only it spits the pages out very fast. If you do two sided it has to suck the page back into the printer which takes much longer. All printers that do duplex do this, so this is not specific to this printer though.We have had the printer be picky about the paper it picks up. There was one certain batch of paper (and we do not remember where it came from, sorry) that it had trouble picking up and jammed once and printed crooked on the rest. Everything else we have fed it has been fine.*ScanningThe scanning seems to be pretty good. The automatic document feeder is a very nice feature, and is something we considered essential – I’m too old to stand there and swap pages manually.Another nice thing about the scanner is that it functions on its own. Some lesser printers require software on a computer and the devices have to be connected and all that in order to scan things. This is a pain and never works well for me. With the Lexmark printer though, you can email the scan jobs and as long as you have the email server set up it requires no computer or additional setup.It’s not immediately obvious, but if you set up what the printer calls a shortcut, that’s basically the address book for the scanner. Also, this is 10x easier to set up if you go to the web page of the printer. It can be done from the front panel but typing on the keyboard is a little painful. Just go to the IP of the printer in your web browser and you can set that up much easier.*Software and DriversThere is also an app that helps you set up wireless and such for the printer. It wasn’t great but it got the job done, just follow the instructions.We have android phones and used the android print plugin. It has low ratings in the play store, but for us it worked well without any issues at all.The latest version of windows 10 found the printer but did not have a driver to print with. If you go to the Lexmark website and type in the printer name, there’s a small download that will install drivers and find the printer and everything seems to work OK.For a mac, I was a little concerned when there wasn’t any mac version of the printer driver to download at first. When I tried to add it anyway I realized that the printer speaks airprint/bonjour and the printer was immediately found and added with no drama whatsoever.*Aesthetics/Fit and finishThe printer is a decent sized one, it’s bigger than most consumer printers, but it’s not huge. It feels well built and does not feel cheap or flimsy.The screen is touch and works very well, with intuitive menus and plenty of options. When you are using the keyboard things get a little tedious, but it does work and works well enough to actually use.The paper tray holds a fair amount of paper, and a nice feature is the printer knows how much paper is in the tray and when you look at “supplies” under the printer driver or in the web page, it will give you a useful indicator of the amount of paper.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGCPEHD3BGXH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,5,1,No,

R21NOJFP9M5O7L,"August 2, 2019",Shane O. Laake,5,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Rather compact and very capable for the price,"The box that the unit shipped in was rather large, though when you remove the foam padding and consider that this is a color laser all in one with duplexing and a sheet feeder, it's rather compact. Setup starts with removing from the aforementioned foam, removing a large bag, and removing a bunch of tear away strips. Note there are pull tabs on all of the toner cartridges as well.Software setup can be completed via an app on your phone, but not if you're rocking the ethernet (which I prefer). Web download of the latest drive is a bit of a pain, as Lexmark uses the whole separate support page vs sales page strategy. The latter comes up first in any searches, but clicking support dumps you at the main support page. Boo! Once you find the software/drivers, it's also a bit of a miss, as I needed to specify my OS and 32/64 bitness, which is very 2009, and not 2019.That aside, the software installed easily, and it defaulted to not sending info back to lexmark--kudos! This thing prints crazy fast--go back to the last sentence and read this thing prints, and that's how long it took to do a full color portrait. Granted this isn't a photo printer, but it'll meet every need short of that expectation. My last home color laser was an OG four pass model, so this is such a revelation! The quality of print is also equal to the task.I don't do a lot of scanning, but it does a solid job, and the feeder is greatly appreciated (the limited scanning I do tends to be multipages documents I've signed). I haven't (and won't) use the fax. Copies are quite snappy!All in all, I love this printer. So much nicer than any inkjet! Toner doesn't bleed, and it's so fast. I haven't used this one enough to speak to reliability, but for now, assume it's spot on (I'll update if/when it isn't).Highly recommended",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21NOJFP9M5O7L?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,4,0,No,
