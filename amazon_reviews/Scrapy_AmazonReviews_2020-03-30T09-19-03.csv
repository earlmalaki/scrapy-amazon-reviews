Wait for more than an hour and it's unreachable with no way to connect unless you go back to factory settings and do everything all over again. Garbage."

STILL ON THE HUNT...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JVYG5FC41HPF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"UPDATE 3.21.20I went to print on the printer for the second time since printing after set up the first day I opened this printer. I saw the same problem as I did with my previous printer. The print quality is splotchy and blurry. Part of the page didn't even print. I tried darkening the toner in the settings - same issue, no difference. I tried doing a test print - even the test print was splotchy and not clear but the very last page said no issues with cartridge. Amazon customer service said try replacing the toner (which would have cost me HUNDREDS of dollars) which was ridiculous. I am still on the hunt for just a decent printer...I am starting to question if there are any good printers out there any more.I tried another brand before this and was an awful experience printing and trying to return it. I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this. Not enough to send back because the printer is so quick and sharp, but a bit annoyed my colors on the screen won't come out on the page exactly. I hope this review helps someone."

LexMark tech support was closed, and they had a non-useful web page about this error, leading me to believe that this may be a common manufacturing defect.Printers are problematic enough when they have been in use for months and years, so I don't want a printer that has problems when it is brand new.

Set up was not easy, but I wouldn't call it difficult. I will update this once I have attempted a multipage document and buy my first replacement toner. Thus far I am very satisfied with its results.I printed a full color 39 page double sided document over WiFi. The document includes color graphs, color and black and white text, images, and color tables. From the time I pressed the print button until it completed printing was 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

I've wasted so much money on bad inkjet printers that clog over time not to mention all the ink cartridges. I run a small business and need a printer only sporadically for invoicing and bulk photo printing. The review...1. The setup was not without it's challenges. You just need to make sure that you connect the Wifi to the printer first through the printer control panel then proceed with downloading the appropriate drivers/apps for your device. I found it really easy to connect the devices actually. My Google phone and Chromebook latched on immediately. I could see how others could have issues figuring this out though. I'm fairly tech savvy but it still took me a few minutes of fiddling. I don't understand the lack of included instructions out of the box or online. You really just need a small note card that could walk you through it but nothing, weird. The printing software is nothing to write home about and typically no frills.2. Quality for text is very good of course since it's a laser. Photos are okay. They aren't as poppy or crisp as most inkjets in the same price range but it's passable, at least for my needs. I didn't expect too much for the photo printing (due to reviews I read) but it actually met or exceeded my expectations. If photos are your main interest then you shouldn't be looking at a laser anyway.3. Although this is compact compared to other laser printers, it's not exactly small. It takes up as much space as a small multifunction inkjet. The advantage is that I can shove this unit into a shelf because it doesn't have a scanner top that you need to lift. I realized over time that I use a scanner maybe once a year so I wanted forgo that function.Initially, I am super happy with this. The price is amazing!! It does exactly what I need it to do for use as a basic office printer. I've been buying inkjets all my life. I hope that I don't have to deal with clogged printer heads ever again. I was also weary of buying a 'Lexmark' since there is very little hype about this brand. But I love the no frills design and function of this unit. If I encounter issues then I will update this review. Otherwise, assume this thing is still kicking butt."

I can only write that the quality is very good. The few pages I did print in one que was very fast and quiet from both my MacBook and iPhone. I did not experience any problems in connecting the wifi and it only took minutes to connect. The negative -- screen is kind of small which makes it difficult to read and in the past I have personally used and owned inkjet so the unit was a lot heavier then Im used to. I don't know how the toner cartridges are set up in terms of black and if the color are all in one or separate.The primary purpose of me purchasing a laserjet is I got tired of the inkjets clogging and so far I am very pleased with that aspect and the overall performance of this lexmark printer. To me it was well worth the almost literal few dollars extra for piece of mind in knowing it so far is dependable in printing if I don't print for a week, or two or more. I think the value is extremely good considering it is not a monotone printer but a color laserjet."

Great deal right? Wait till you have to buy toner for it. At around $75 each it will cost you $300 to put ink in this printer. Ha!I am updating my review on this printer after over a month of use. At first I was very concerned over the cost of the cartridges. After using it for a while now I am extremely concerned over the cost of the cartridges and the actual pages you get per cartridge.I am printing shipping labels with this printer in black and white. I got about 170 lables with the partial cartridge that it comes with. Today I ordered the third black cartridge from Lexmark. According to the printer count I have printed a total of 766 pages and have used up the starter cartridge and one of the brand new full cartridges. This is an absolutely miserable page count considering Lexmark claims I should be getting 1500+ pages per cartridge.The only reason I went with this printer was because I used to run a Lexmark 250DN printer here in the office. We got well over 1000 pages on each cartridge with that old printer. Guess newer isn't always better. Sad.

I do recommend updating the firmware right after setting it up. It still blows my mind that I am able to buy an excellent quality laser COLOR printer at this price.Print quality is very good. Color saturation and coverage is uniform and rich. I read reviews that complained about how noisy the printer is. That has not been my experience. I only print wireless from Mac, iPhone and Windows without any connectivity problems.I had one problem. Out of the box the printer was printing a series of dots lined vertically 1/2 inch from the right edge, spaced exactly one inch apart on every page. I called Lexmark support who quickly had me run printer diagnostics (again, from the printer display panel). He determined that the problem was caused by the black toner cartridge. He shipped me a new cartridge (full size, not the starter one!), which solved the problem. While it was disappointing to have a problem like this on a brand new printer, Lexmark made up for it. I hope the printer will last for at least 3-4 years, but only time will tell."

I can buy Lexmark high yield toner package for $350 or standard yield for $275. I think I will throw this printer in the garbage and buy something new. I cannot afford toner that expensive, I had just assumed there is always an aftermarket of generic toners, but this printer must not sell in high enough numbers for aftermarket companies to make toners. It will be cheaper for me to throw this away and buy another brand printer that does have aftermarket toners available.Original Review: Home printers are throw away items. They usually don't last more a year, if they do, they need new rollers, drums, etc that cost more than a new printer. My Canon Imageclass MF634cdw was flawless for one year. Got it loaded and up and running in 20 minutes. After one year it started making awful grinding noises and printing badly, etc. Time for something new.This was only $114 and has the auto duplex function. It lacks the all-in-one document feeder and scanner, but I can still use that on my old Imageclass. Setup was difficult (much harder than my Canon was), and the printer could not be detected on my wifi, so I had to google how to load a print driver using an IP address. I've never done this before. Took me about 5 hours to set this printer up on my 2 computers (desktop & laptop), but it prints quickly and quietly. Auto duplex works perfect. After 5 days, it has not gone offline, not had any paper jams, no issues at all.I will update this if I have any issues, but after 5 days, despite some annoyances in getting it up and running, I am very please for only $114."

But it is awesome so far!I'm replacing a 20-year-old high-end Brother printer, so I'll compare it to that. The Brother cost $600 20 years ago, so I was not expecting much at all from a $117 printer.Most of the negative reviews mentioned trouble connecting via WiFi. My first thought was I didn't care about that. I've never had a WiFi printer in the past and didn't see any reason it would be necessary now. However, I have gotten married since 20 years ago and we have kids and more computers in the house, so I figured if it worked that would be great and if not, well, it was only $117 and we didn't have a networked printer in the past so it would be okay.Of course, once it arrived, connecting it to WiFi became my first obsession! I guess I just wanted to try it that cool new feature!I've never connected a printer to WiFi and wasn't sure how it worked. The printed materials that came with the printer were totally useless. It's all pictures, no words and nothing about connecting via Wifi. But, all the info you need, really, is on the printer screen. Even though it's tiny, I was able to get the information I needed from it to connect it up.Basically, I turned the printer on, read the directions as they scrolled across on the tiny screen and followed the directions. It mentioned a Lexmark printer app, which I downloaded. I was able to quickly and easily connect the app on my phone to the printer and from there it was a breeze. It went through the steps and I was able to print from my phone. Which again, was not something I had ever imagined doing, much less anything I needed or wanted to do. But it worked and that was cool!Then it was off to connect two computers to it. First I plugged it in by wire to my wife's computer - which I think might have been a mistake. But at the time I thought that's how you had to do it. For some reason I wasn't able to get it to connect via WiFi on her computer because while the computer ""saw"" the printer, it kept asking me for a WPS PIN which it said was either printed on the printer or was on the printed materials that came with the printer. It was on neither.I gave up on that and went to install it via WiFi only on my computer. Actually I didn't really have to do anything. I opened the Printer Settings on my computer and clicked Add Printer, then find WiFi connected printer and it was right there. So it was already broadcasting the signal to all devices in our house and all I had to do was click Connect - and it worked like a charm. The weird thing though is it didn't ask me for any WPS PIN for my computer. And I'm guessing that's because I never connected it via wire - so it didn't halfway install itself by wire only to get confused by WiFi? I don't know. But I did not ever attach it to my computer with a wire and the WiFi connected up absolutely flawlessly.Then I went back to my wife's computer and using the disk that came with the printer I installed the drivers from that. And once that was done, suddenly it worked fine as a WiFi printer. Although it shows up in Printer Settings as (copy1) of the first attempted installation by wire, which still works if it's plugged in with the wire.Then for the big test. I moved the printer to another room! Would we both be able to print on it from our respective offices? My wife's office is closest and mine is further away... about 50 feet away and several drywall walls. From my wife's office, everything went off without a hitch. From my office - same result. Print Perfect both times.My old $600 Brother printer did excellent color prints, and this one does as well - for 1/6th the price. I printed a few photos from the Lexmark, as a test, and was absolutely amazed at their quality. They're almost photo-printer quality. In fact, if I printed them on laser photo paper, I think they'd look good enough to frame and hang.The other nifty feature is the double-sided print feature. Maybe this is something that's been common among printers for the last few years, I'm not sure. But if you're not used to it, it's very cool. It will print on both sides of the paper - automatically. In other words, you don't have to print on one side and then stick the page in upside down and print the other side manually anymore. It will print the first side, then suck the page back into the printer and print the other side! It's really amazing to watch if you've never seen a printer do this before. And it's so fast.One other plus factor is that it's much smaller and lighter than our old printer. The old one, I literally can't lift by myself it's so darn heavy. Something around 100 pounds I think. But this one is much easier to lift, it's like a heavy suitcase. We also appreciate that it takes up much less space than the old behemoth did.One con so far... they include about 7 or 8 sheets of paper (printed on both sides - that's 16 pages of printing) with nothing other than safety warnings - in every imaginable language. The length of the English text wouldn't take up more than about 2 paragraphs, not even a full page. So it's a colossal waste of paper they include and completely unnecessary. Not to mention the hassle they cause all their customers with so much extra paper they have to throw out. BIG WASTE. I have to think that the United States is their largest market and as such might warrant it's own version of this in English and perhaps Spanish. But no... they literally had to print it in almost every major language on earth - and send it in every major language to every customer! Totally ridiculous, wasteful and annoying.The only instructions are what looks like a hand-drawn diagram with little arrows drawn here and there. Not a single word printed on these two pages - where words would be extremely helpful. Apparently the folks at Lexmark don't want to *offend* anyone by writing in the language/languages spoken in the United States only, so they opt not to print any words at all. As if instructions in English might offend people! Like the United States is such a small market it's not worth their time and effort to print in English and Spanish.Other than that big annoyance though, we're both very pleased with this purchase. I'm still amazed at all the complaints - and really surprised it has only a 3.7-star review score. That's way below where it should be in my humble opinion.I have seen some reviewers say it worked well at first but after a few weeks it went bad. So, if that happens here, I'll come back and definitely adjust my score accordingly, and revise my review to let you know."

The print quality is superb and it prints double sided to save paper. The printer prints fairly quietly and quickly. The best part of this color laser printer is it’s compact design. It fits in the same spot as our smaller inkjet printer. The set up was very easy as you just download the Lexmark iOS app (I use an iPhone 8 Plus) and then you just connect to your WiFi and you’re basically set up and ready for printing. Overall, I would recommend this printer.*If you found my review helpful, please let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below!**Disclosure: I received a sample product from the Amazon Vine program for an honest and unbiased review."

We look forward to hearing from you soon.","I selected 1 star because it won't let me select negative stars. I'm not a person who writes reviews, ever. I'm a reasonable person who understands you get what you pay for. I also understand this isn't and wasn't designed to be a ""great printer."" But, this is the biggest POS I've ever purchased. Not exaggerating at all, if I were to print something 15 times, 13 times it crumples the hell out of the paper and doesn't print properly, 1 of 15 times it jams and 1 of 15 times it prints OK, but at a slight angle. Do not buy this thing."

I used to have a small HP printer which was ok for my needs or what I thought it was enough for my need. See I have a small business is home based and I’ve never thought of buying a business style printer and Man, was I wrong! First, I was shocked at how compact this Lexmark printer is and was so surprised at the same time how powerful and fast it was, this thing is a workhorse. Specially I can send anything via WIFI and no more of running cables and tripping over them.Setup was very easy. From unpacking it, to printing my first page was about 5-10 minutes. I was also surprised at how fast it prints. The print quality was sharp, bold and clear. My only struggle was when I tried to switch from plain paper to labels, the label paper is slick on the back side and the first two sheets I tried did not want to get picked up by the coil. So, I had to take out the labels and air the sheets. What I’ve noticed is that It really helps if you keep the tray full. After doing this, printing has been a breeze.Overall, this printer has changed my mind 180 degree in favor of having a business printer. I am very happy with it, especially the speed. highly recommended."

R39U02I9NMEL2E,"August 12, 2019",Benjamin H. George,Verified Purchase,4,C3224dw,N/A,51,1,No,Doesn't have enough memory to print multi-page documents,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39U02I9NMEL2E?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"I took a chance and got this printer based on the positive Amazon Vine reviews. The set up was a breeze, even using just the control panel and not the app. However, I tried printing a 20-page PDF that has a file size of 5mb. The printer could not process the PDF and would only print a single page and give me an error saying that the memory is full. So then I tried to just print two pages from the PDF, and it can't even handle that. If it can't print a multi-page document it is pretty worthless. And there is no way you can print 24 pages a minute if you have to print them one page at a time. If you just want to print a single page all the time, than this printer would be great for you, and the print quality was good. But if you need to print a multi-page document... you'll want to look somewhere else. Needless to say, I will be returning this and buying another HP or Brother printer.Update #1 - I spent a whole day trying to get this printer to work. I reinstalled it multiple times, restored factory settings, reset it up, updated the printer firmware, updated my operating system, and then finally figured out that if I installed it using generic post script printing and boom! it works. There was zero support on the Lexmark website. So they lose a star for that."

Installing it was not nearly as easy as I expected, especially given the experiences I’ve had with other brands. It took multiple tries and loads of patience to finally get it done.You have to have a smart phone to install this. I tried to install from my laptop and it wouldn’t. I was required to download an app from Lexmark to just connect my phone and printer. Then I was able to use that app to connect the printer and my internet. Once that was completed I was able to connect to it with the laptop. To print from my phone, it looks like another app is needed.I did to a test print and it seems to be working. The printing was fine but not as crisp as I expected. But, I’ll see as I use it if that gets better."
R37RL5T5TGKE8V,"August 8, 2019",MyOhMy,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,Easy to Setup and Great Looking Output,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37RL5T5TGKE8V?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,This took about 10 minutes from box to working. The longest part of it was loading the disk onto my computer so it could print wirelessly. I used the mobile app to get it started and then popped in the disk and I was ready to go. It's probably the easiest printer I've ever set up. I sent some color pages to the printer and it did a beautiful dual side printing where the colors on the paper look just like the original did from my screen. A simple basic laser color printer. This is a winner!
R2D8D7FIKARD1S,"August 7, 2019",optimummind,Vine Customer,4,C3224dw,N/A,1,0,No,Good-value color laser printer with inconsistent wake-up printing time.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D8D7FIKARD1S?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"=== My Take ===The Lexmark C3224dw is my first ever color laser printer and I like it very much for the most part. I like its compact and space-saving design and dimensions despite its heavier than expected heft. The control panel screen is bright & clear and the buttons around it are very responsive to my inputs. It is very intuitive to operate even without consulting the user manual first.I also liked its print quality - both in color and black & white. Text and images came out clear and smudge-free and the printing speed was satisfactory. Print operations were quiet, even the warm-up routine. Intermittently, however, the printer took an unusually long time to wake up from its Sleep & Hibernate status. There were times when we waited for longer than 30 seconds before the printer began flashing its light & started to print. Once it got warmed up, though, all later printer jobs printed at normal and satisfactory speeds.Another strong point for the C3224dw is its fast and simple setup process. I added it to my home network using just the control panel buttons to select my home WiFi and typing in the password. This process was seamless and very smooth. I also connected the printer to my desktop via a USB Type B cable (not included in the box) and installed the printer by installing the driver package from the Lexmark website. You also have the option to set it up using an Ethernet cable (also not included).Despite easily adding the printer to my home WiFi, however, none of my Windows 10 laptops around the house could find the printer during an actual print job, such as from Microsoft Word and Chrome browser. My wifey, who is not very techy, got frustrated because the printer wasn't listed in the printer selection drop-down menu. I had to go to Settings in Windows 10 and add the printer manually by typing in its IP address on each of my laptops. Compared to my other printers from Brother and HP, this part of my printing experience was subpar and disappointing. I expected a big printer company such as Lexmark to do a better job integrating the C3224dw to Windows 10.Another surprising thing was that there was no Windows 10 Lexmark app for the C3224dw printer. In order to access its settings, I had to launch the Embedded Web Server by opening a browser such as Chrome and then typing in its IP address. I guess some people might prefer this approach because it is one less app you have to install but I wouldn't have minded a Windows 10 app. You can install the Lexmark phone app but I chose not to do so because I have too many apps installed already on my Galaxy S10+ (>200).Once you access the printer settings via the Embedded Web Server, things are pretty straightforward and easy to navigate within. There are two main settings categories - Status & Settings. Under Status, you can view any Alerts & Warnings messages, Supply/Toner status, and printer info (firmware version, paper bin status).Under Settings, there are six additional sub-categories: Device, Print, Paper, Network/Ports, Security, and Reports.Under the Device section, I found the following options to be useful for our home - setting up low printer supply email notifications, configuring Sleep & Hibernate timeouts, turning on Eco Mode, and performing a firmware update.Inside the Print section, I turned on Duplex printing & the Collate option and set image printing to ""Auto Fit.""Inside the Network/Ports section, I left alone all the numerous options at their default (Wireless, AirPrint, Ethernet, TCP/IP, SNMP, IPSec, 802.1x, LPD, HTTP/FTP, USB, Restrict external network access, WiFi Direct) but did activate Google Cloud Print.I also left everything at default in the Security sub-section.Although the Settings page is plain and simple-looking, navigation among the options was quick, responsive, and very satisfactory and I appreciated all options given to me.All in all, I'm happy & satisfied with the Lexmark C3224dw and I don't regret getting it. Hopefully future firmware updates will improve printer wakeup time from its Sleep/Hibernate status._____*Pros:-Easy setup (WiFi or USB Type B).-Control panel buttons are responsive and intuitive to use.-Both color and black & white prints come out nice and clear.-Compact footprint.-Quiet operation.-Supports Lexmark Mobile Print, Google Cloud Print, Mopria Print, Apple AirPrint, and Wifi Direct.-Settings page offer numerous fine-tuning, network, and security options._____*Neutral:-Pretty heavy~!!-Wake-up time from Sleep is longer than I prefer.-Printer didn't get auto-detected by Windows 10 on all of my laptops on my home network. I had to add it manually by entering its IP address.-Performing a firmware update over the Embedded Web Server isn't as easy & simple as doing it with a Windows 10 or smartphone app.-Cartridge replacements will cost around $300 for all four._____*Cons:-Once in a while, print jobs over WiFi took TOO long. Inconsistent response times."

Initially I thought I was not going to be able to do it and would have to get help. Then after looking at it sitting in my kitchen I decided to try. The hardest part was preparing the printer. Removing the covers on the ink, easy. Removing all the tape, easy. Finding copy paper and loading the tray, easy. Now turning it on, easy. Following the instructions, easy. Still waiting for the hard part.. found a picture to test print. My iPad found the printer and picture was printed. Can it be any easier, I don’t think so. I wish I could discuss the specs and other technical information but this lady isn’t knowledgeable. All I know is the printer was easy to setup and printed a great picture."
R1I0G70F6ZF1SI,"July 31, 2019",Dale,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,10,0,No,"Well, it has a lot to live up to. So far so good...",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I0G70F6ZF1SI?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"I am using this to replace a Brother laser printer (NO COLOR, NO WIFI) that I have used for 6 years and it was still going strong.So far I don’t regret the upgrade to this Lexmark. While it’s no faster to print than the Brother, it isn’t slower, and is MUCH quieter, which I like in my office setting. Print quality on the whole is excellent. As far as the color printing goes (which I don’t do much of), it looks good, but not great. You won’t confuse it for a photo printer, nor is it intended to be. For color documents, it’s MINT!What I don’t like...well, set up was sort of annoying. The machine prompts you to download the app on your phone, which I did. No matter what I couldn’t get the thing to connect. So I wound up backing out of the set up and doing it manually from the printer. Took forever punching in my cryptic WiFi password with no keyboard. After that, I did get a strange error about the Cyan cartridge. I cleared it and it hasn’t come back, so we will see.Overall it’s well made, has a good “heft” to it. It occupies only about the same space as my old B&W printer, which is impressive. Servicing and toner replacement is easy. It has a lot going for it, and so far I am thrilled with it!***3+ month update**** printer has been perfect. I use it every day and have not had a single paper jam or any other issues. This is a nice printer! Continues to impress!!"
R31BL20KZA0QSQ,"July 29, 2019",Ugh,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,3,0,No,A little clunky setup at first but great quality prints,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BL20KZA0QSQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Printers can be hit-and-miss when it comes to setting them up and this one is no different. Upon powering up, the screen prompts you to approve several settings before eventually reaching a point where you'll continue via Lexmark's mobile app, or, continue with setting up on the printer directly. I opted to go to mobile app route since I'd be connecting to my wi-fi network and entering a password on the printer's minimalist screen would be a pain.On the mobile app, you'll be prompted to connect to a wi-fi signal being output by the printer, and from there you'll tell it what wi-fi network you want IT to connect to, along with the password, and you're set!...or rather...you should be. For me, everything appeared to be setup just fine, but for some reason, I still had to manually select a network and enter the password on the printer itself. Not really sure what went wrong, but that was a little annoying. Once connected, simply install the printer's driver software from the included disc (or download from Lexmark site) and you should be set.Besides that minor inconvenience, printing quality is perfect, and fast. It goes to sleep automatically after a period of not being used, and it doesn't make any noise or mechanical adjustments when being turned on/off, or when sleeping, or being woken. Other printers I've had all seem to make noise when doing this and this sometimes occurred in the middle of the night too, so it'd be a bit startling, but this Lexmark is perfectly quiet in this respect.Overall, really nice printer that does its job well."
RYLHERBWWYBU8,"July 28, 2019",MWCraft,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,17,0,No,Excellent Output; Easy Local or WIFI Setup,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYLHERBWWYBU8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Below are my thoughts/observations on the Lexmark C3224dw Color Laser Printer. Some pictures are also included.Setup- the printer box had illustrations on top showing how to remove the printer from the box. I found that helpful and accurate in how best to begin the setup process.- Inside, a two sided sheet showed additional instructions for removing the tape, setting up the toner cartridges (which were already installed) and adding paper- It came with an installation CD for use in setting the printer up as locally attached to a PC. - You will need to supply your own USB printer cord and connect it to the printer and PC. - Turn on the printer; load the CD in your computer’s drive and the install process will begin automatically (I installed it on a Windows 10 desktop). In a couple of minutes, my PC sent a pop-up message that it was done.- While the CD was installing the printer drivers, etc. to my PC, the printer itself also displayed messages on its display screen: - First, it asked if I wanted to setup the phone app. I declined this since I did not want another phone app. - Next, it walked me through the steps to set it up on my home WIFI. This was pretty easy to do but unavoidably repetitive. I.e., if your WIFI name is “KatManDu-74”, you will have to enter each upper/lowercase letter, character or number by repeatedly pressing an arrow key for each one then hitting “OK”. Not difficult to do but boring. This, of course, took longer to complete than the automated process with the CD.Output QualtiyIt is excellent. I printed multiple photographs and they looked great and also printed some test prints and plain text documents that also looked really good.Printing Through WIFIWithout installing any apps to my iPhone or iPad, I was able to print multiple photos even though the WIF router was upstairs and I was in the basement sitting next to the printer. This means the image was transmitted through the floor/walls to the router and back through the floor/walls to the printer without issue.Overall ImpressionsAs stated earlier, I did not install or test any Lexmark printing apps (for the phone or PC) but do not think they are needed for wireless/remote printing. They may have other features (low toner warnings, etc.) that you may desire so, that is a choice you must make..It is quiet, and gives excellent quality output whether locally attached to your PC or sitting as a standalone device on your WIFI. You also have the option of connecting it to your network using an Ethernet cable but I did not test that since making the WIFI connection was so simple.I am very happy with the Lexmark C224DW printer."
