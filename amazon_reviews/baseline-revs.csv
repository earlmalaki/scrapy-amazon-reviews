RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,3,MB2236adw,,Verified Purchase,57,6,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights"," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too.",Yes,"Hello - We wanted to respond and thank you for your recent comments on the Lexmark MB2236adw.

RRBP7OITNW73Q,"August 11, 2019",socrchik2000,4,MB2236adw,,Verified Purchase,7,1,Scan solution?,"After reading the reviews that talked about the SMTP problems and scanning problems and setup, I just wanted to put my 2cents in.  I got the printer on a Friday and I must agree that the absence of instructions other than for taking the item out of the box and turning it on are sorely lacking.  I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome.  However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work.  Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error.  I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message!  The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now.",No,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRBP7OITNW73Q?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG

This copier is completely worthless.  I thought Lexmark was a good brand.  I have a Lexmark printer I have used for several years.  Very happy with it.

RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,4,MB2236adw,,Verified Purchase,3,0,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.","PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download  a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience.",No,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYUB0RC2X96PZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG

Had I know this, I would have picked a different all-in-one.  That being said, I like how this one prints and the fact that it prints double sided.  It is also easy to make copies.  Update 2/27/20  I figured out that this will scan to your local PC if you use Windows Fax and Scan.

R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,3,MB2236adw,,Vine Customer,4,0,Solid printer with one major downfall,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A  functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option.",No,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R267GU2ETRU9V7?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG
R3LW0NN16FHC9M,"November 1, 2019",Theresa J.,1,MB2236adw,,Unverified,5,0,Scanner functionlity,"Looks good and reads well on Amazon, however this printer is dysfunctional for everyday use.  There is no USB port to print to and for scanning you have to open an application even though the printer key pad option actually have a scan prompt cability.  When you use that function, it gives you a hard copy of the document.  The technical support team lacks the knowledge about the printer functionalities.

R369M0HXD51CGA,"July 12, 2019",CorpGovNet,4,MB2236adw,,Vine Customer,1,0,"OEM Refills Only, Since New Model: Setup Difficult","This is a great quality printer. Prints quickly with high quality imaging. Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular. I pay around 1/2 a cent for the ink for each page on my black and white Brother... although sometimes it isn't as nice and crispy as it should be.",No,,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R369M0HXD51CGA?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG

Monochrome","I originally got this for my kids to use -- school projects are going to bankrupt me -- but I've been so impressed that this has become my main default printer.  It will print, copy, scan and fax.  Setup was simple for me -- driver update and off we go . . . and I found that it did all the things it was supposed to easily.  It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser.  The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall).  The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning.  I miss that more than I thought I would.  It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that.  I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color.  And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain.  Two line scrolling menu to control the printer?  SHEESH.  Horribly cumbersome.  BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again.  Oh, and the smtp error.  That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother.  That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit.  For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk.

This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but  my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids.

The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text).
