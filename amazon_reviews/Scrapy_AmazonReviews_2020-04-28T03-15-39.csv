Printing is fast and clean. The toner cartridge is easy to install and should last a long time.The printer supports USB, ethernet and WIFI connectivity. The small LCD screen makes setup simple and is also handy in daily operations. You can also manage the printer via the web interface which provides printer status and additional configuration and print functions.If you are running Windows 10 the built in drivers will work just fine there is no need to install the Lexmark suite unless there is some specific feature that the suite provides.

It was very easy to set up and start using. There is nothing super flashy about the printer, but I do not think there needs to be.The one issue that we have had is that it was printing with a streak through the page.

RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",PBV-JSV,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively. Just be prepared to work though some issues with the initial setup.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EARTFHZLR1C9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
RO0E62GO6HF52,"March 31, 2020",C.G.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great option for home or small business owners who simply need a quick monochrome printer,"I've owned several Lexmark products over the years and I've never experienced any issues with any of them.This printer, while very simple compared to many printers on the market, is very nicely made, dependable, quick, and produces very high quality printed pages.Because of the simplicity of this being a printer only, set-up is little more than 10 minutes, max. I chose to connect via cord, but you have wireless options present.Printing speed, for me, hits 41 PPM. When I do speed print with this, every page is consistent in quality. No issues, of note.Sound wise, this isn't exactly a quiet printer, but it's not obnoxious, either.Overall footprint is quite small; this can easily be hidden if you so choose.Overall build quality and parts are very high. As I mentioned above, Lexmark makes great stuff and this printer is no different.In sum, this is a great option for the home or small business. It's a simply monochrome printer, but if that's all you need, this is a very good, viable, well situated option.I have no reservations recommending this printer.Recommended4 starsCheers!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO0E62GO6HF52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,

RA4TT0RCQT8VK,"March 27, 2020",Robert J. Newell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast, Good Print Quality, Easy to Hook Up, But Where's the Toner?","Let's be clear, it's a good printer. It was easy to set up, has decent features, and the print quality is good.Setup: cabled setup is easy, although if you're not going to go wireless, you'll have to supply your own cable, whether USB or Ethernet. I won't dock them for that, although they could have said ""cable not supplied"" in their writeups. This just worked out of the box on my Linux system. For Windows, you should probably download drivers from the Lexmark support site. Not sure about Mac.Wireless setup is accomplished from the little display window on the printer. I've always found this annoying but if you run Windows and want to install their software you can avoid this. But there is nothing hard about it, just a little tedium, and it works as it should, although I always prefer the Ethernet option. (Tip: on your router, assign a fixed IP address to the printer. This makes life easier for non-USB connections.)Okay, how does it work? Just fine. Double sided printing is wonderful, print quality is great, speed is about what you'd expect today--- in other words, very good for a home printer used by a few people. (Don't expect to use this in a 20 person office, though.) It's a light-duty printer, very suitable for a home office.Build quality is good. Don't drop it off tall buildings, but don't be afraid to move it around or carry it around. It should stand up just fine.Now, the one gripe. Toner. It comes with the plague of printers in pretty much the last decade, the dreaded ""starter"" cartridge. This is a cartridge that is maybe 10% full, meaning you have to buy a real cartridge almost right away. And guess what, the cartridge price is in the same range as the printer price in most cases. Manufacturers don't have to make money on the printer, they make it on the cartridge.The ""starter"" is supposed to be good for 500 pages, about one ream. If that holds up, depending on your needs, you might get a week or two in a busy home office, and maybe a month or two of really casual use.So you better order that cartridge. You go to the Lexmark site and ... oh my, they aren't selling them. Maybe a little later on? Better hope so, or pretty soon you'll have a brick. This is 100% inexcusable. And comparing similar Lexmark printers, the cartridge will be over a hundred dollars. Wow.Usually there are 3rd-party cartridges, often for about 15% of the price. That's what I always buy for my other printers; I find a reputable vendor and buy from them. But you cannot get the cartridge for this printer anywhere at the time of this writing (late March 2020).I'm going to provisionally rate the printer four stars. After all, it's a very good product. I would have gone five if the cartridges were available at a fair price. I will revisit this later. If in a month or two you still can't get the cartridge, the rating will be one star.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4TT0RCQT8VK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,1,0,No,
R2E0YW6BHGAOSB,"March 23, 2020",JoeInTampa,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast print from cold start, easy to set up.  Clean print.  Needs documentation.","This is a very nice monochrome laser printer. One I had previously took a long time to print from a cold start. This one begins to print almost as quiickly as an inkjet printer. Print quality is excellent and print speed is high. Wireless setup was very quick and easy. I like Lexmark's Unison toner. It separates the toner cartridge and the imaging unit unlike other toner cartridges where the units are combined. The Unison toner cartridge doesn't need shaking to equalize printing and prints at lower temperature than previous types of toner, so that means lower energy costs as well as quicker printing from a cold start. My only issue is probably due to this being a new item that I received through the Amazon Vine program. There is no online documentation specific to this model and I have been unable to determine the toner replacement cartridge for this unit. I assume that will change once this is a fully supported printer. All things considered, this is a great printer.

RU29785I48QOO,"March 18, 2020",LifeIsGood,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Speedy monochrome for the small or home office,"This compact laser printer (8 3/4"" H x 14"" W x 14"" D) does just one thing, but it does it very well. From sleep to first page out is under 10 seconds and pages print at the advertised speed, even using the duplexer, which I love. The picture instructions are bad, and there is nothing else, but once you get the printer out of the box they kind of make sense. This does not come with any cables other than power, so if you want to connect other than wirelessly you will need an Ethernet cable to connect to your network or a printer cable (with that squarish connector) to connect to your computer. I opted for wireless as I wanted to test this with my Android tablet as well. Once you power on the printer you have to use the 2-line monochrome screen to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that if you connect to a network it has to be 2G and not 5G. The driver for this is not on the Lexmark site as of this review, so I had to use the CD (I tried with the Windows driver and the pages printed like a negative, but the Lexmark software fixed that). The Lexmark app installed fine on my Android tablet (Samsung) and I was able to print from there as well.

RX72XBHQ26O0T,"March 16, 2020",Man in the Middle,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Very fast and works well. PC setup is easy. Mac setup is manual.,"The first thing I noticed on setting up this new printer is that it came with only one page of pictorial setup info, and no manual. It did include a driver CD, but my iMac running Catalina couldn't find any files it could run on that. In addition, searching the Lexmark website found no useful information about this new B3442dw model (though I did find a brochure about its likely predecessor, the B2442dw.)Fortunately, I was easily able to set the printer up properly anyway. Just remove all the packing materials both around the toner cartridge and on the outside of the case, load some paper, and power the printer on. A built-in small display will talk you through the needed initial settings, including entering a password to join your WiFi network. From there it was simple to tell my iMac to add a printer, and chose that one from the bonjour list that appeared. Once set up, its Options & Supplies button in the driver allows all other settings to be seen and customized easily.Since I do also have a Windows 10 laptop PC (Dell Inspiron XPS 15), I WAS quickly and easily able to install a driver on that, using the included CD.Once a driver was installed, printing on both the iMac and the Dell was a simple matter of choosing the Lexmark printer for a document. The result was blazingly fast (I've never seen such quick duplex printing before), and good quality.Overall, this is an excellent printer, lacking only a bit more attention to documentation to be fully ready for prime time on Macs in addition to Windows PCs.Update: Just discovered an interesting problem. For no obvious reason, the link to this printer at IP address 192.168.1.26 has also taken over the link to my Western Digital MyCloudEx2Ultra at IP address 192.168.1.2. Attempting to open a Web page at 192.168.1.2 shows the printer's web page, the same as if I'd opened the page at 192.168.1.26. And the MyCloud can't be accessed unless the printer is powered off. Those two addresses should NOT be in conflict, but somehow are. I'll update once I figure it out.Update 2: No toner is listed as available yet for this printer, either here at Amazon or at the maker's website. Whether the toner for the earlier model B2442dw would also work on this new model is unknown. The printer comes with a starter toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX72XBHQ26O0T?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R2558N1P0X0T8S,"March 15, 2020",Eric L.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Full Featured Networkable Printer,"The printer does not seem to come with a USB cable. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one on hand or buy one. Or at least mine didn’t come with any cables other than power. That was ok for me because I am using Ethernet and I have a bunch of spare Ethernet cables, and there is also wireless connectivity available. But USB likely the easiest way to get up and running for non-techies, so if this is you, have a spare printer cable lying around, or purchase one with the printer. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one or buy one.Once unpacked and set up following the crude pictograms included, it was necessary to download the drivers and install them. The unit does come with a CD installer disk, but even if you have an antique computer with an optical drive, it makes more sense to go to the Lexmark website and download the latest drivers. Who knows how old the ones on the CD are?After plugging the printer into my switch using Ethernet, and running the installer, the software could not find the printer, nor was it listed by my router as being connected (though the Ethernet activity lights on the printer were flashing). Eventually, I noticed that the small LCD display on the top of the printer had some questions about time, date, and language that must be answered on the printer before it will even show up on the network. After completing the setup on the small LCD screen, the printer was connected but the installer still could not find it. Instructions would have been helpful here, especially for people who aren’t technically inclined, but you can probably find help online.It was necessary for me to go to my router’s web page, get the printer’s DHCP provided IP address, and plug that into the installer manually in the “advanced set up” area. Also, it asks for you to manually type in the port name. I typed in “Ethernet” (no quotes) and it worked, the installer was able to proceed. After doing this on my main computer, I went back to the router and assigned a fixed IP address to the printer so that I will have no trouble finding it when I install the driver on my laptop and other computers.The software itself is nice and compact. I have a Canon printer that came with software that’s all up in your face all the time… meaning, it came with a bunch of bloatware like scrapbooking apps and card making apps and a bunch of docks and control panels that I had to carefully remove after writing the review. In the case of this Lexmark, it’s all business and it’s not in your face at all, and I appreciate that.The printer is fast and quiet. Over Ethernet, when I send a page the printer, it’s done printing before I can even start wondering how long it will take. Coming from an inkjet printer, this is really nice. Also, the network connectivity is indispensable these days. It certainly is if you have two or more devices in your life that you’d like to print from. That network connectivity also makes it easy to tweak the settings as the printer publishes a web page that you can reach from any web browser (if connected to from your local network). Just type the IP address of the printer into your browser and the settings page comes up. By the way, this is another good reason to assign a static IP to the printer; you can then just add a bookmark to your browser. That administrative web page allows you to change many parameters in several categories. Some of the settings are beyond my paltry comprehension, but there is a lot there that is useful to me, and some of it I’m sure is useful to IT personnel deploying these things on larger networks. There are a lot of IT tweaks and settings available here.The printer is handsome looking and compact, and it feels durable and professional. I think it will be perfect for my home office. Every computer I have can now print quickly and quietly from anywhere in the house.The unit comes with a toner cartridge that is described as a “starter cartridge.” It’s not clear to me how many pages we will get out of this; also, at the time of writing this, I couldn’t find replacement cartridges on Amazon or on the Lexmark site. No doubt they will be rolling these out soon; I just hope it’s sooner than my “starter cartridge” lasts. When available, I expect the replacement cartridges to cost well north of $100 each.I remember when laser printers cost a couple thousand dollars each, and then you had to pay extra for network connectivity. The price of this one is very appealing. In fact, it seems like a steal at this price. Just don’t forget that they get you on the toner, same as inkjet makers get you on the ink. There’s still no free lunch.Other than that, I’m delighted with this little printer. It really is quite perfect for a small office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2558N1P0X0T8S?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R10V9WCIQS76AL,"March 14, 2020",Summit,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,FAST! Love it!,"This is a no-frills, monochrome printer without all the fancy touch-screen nonsense. What it does, it does perfectly- spit out paper quickly.I print a LOT while I'm working on some business plans, consulting and getting my MBA just for giggles despite being retired. My color laser eats toner as if it is free and it most certainly isn't. Having a monochrome, fast, two-sided printer as a default is the best idea ever... save that color printing for when it's actually necessary. It's surprising how often one does NOT need color, and the cost savings of not wasting printing in color is significant.I set this up without looking at directions, as I always do. Initially, it didn't detect ANY WiFi networks in my house when there are actually five of them. This was odd, but after several tries it started to see them. I had to go through typing the password through the simple buttons and simple display three times, but it finally connected and all is well.There is an app for this as well as computer software, but I chose to do everything without adding yet another app or yet another bit of software on my computer. It's likely far easier to do it with the apps etc- so unless you're just a glutton for punishment like me, just use their app.When it came time to print, this is when I became a big fan... it spits paper like crazy! I set it to print a large document, four pages per side, double sided... and wow, it was racing through it so much faster than any other printer I've had. SUPER fast at getting prints done. The print quality is fantastic, too. Double-sided printing saves SO much paper and space, too.Lexmark has always been one of my favorite printer suppliers, mostly known for their commercial machines. My last Lexmark was a color laser which was a complete disaster and never worked well at all. It ended up being recycled without ever having a successful print. Lexmark has redeemed themselves with this one- it's a business class machine that will absolutely STUN you with how fast it can put out pages. The ads say 42 pages per minute... which is faster than what I got, but plausible.Bravo, Lexmark.

R11DKZI7FM2KDF,"April 22, 2020",Eric,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Outstanding Printer,"The printer creates crisp clean output and preferences regarding resolution, darkness, brightness, etc. can be selected by the user. This device arrives with a toner cartridge that is stated to print 1500 copies. The setup was super easy. The app instructed me should go to Settings on iPhone, find printer name shown on the printer display, and connect to my local WiFi network using my network passphrase. Then I returned to the app and followed the remaining steps. If not planning to connect to WiFi, connect to a wired network using the Ethernet port, or connect directly with a USB cable. this is an outstanding and reliable printer. For mac users, it is especially nice because AirPrint has been fully implemented, which is not the case for many printers I have bought which claim to support it, but have only a partial implementation.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11DKZI7FM2KDF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,0,0,No,
R2IL5WOCYEQBP6,"April 19, 2020",Hyytekk,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Why do printer manufacturers assume everyone employs an IT department?,"Printers are supposed to be patient servants who sit idle, but snap to attention when you need them. They do seem too if you have a wired connection. Adding Wifi seems to reduce the printer's IQ by half. Unless you have your own IT department or a 12 year old close by to rescue you. Now that that's out of the way, here are my impressions of this Lexmark B3340 so far. I was looking for a replacement for my Cannon, that was most of all intuitive and whose Wifi just plain worked every time. Unboxing seemed promising but suspect since documentation included one sheet of printed media and a DVD. The single sheet of ""instructions"" contained no words, just a few cave wall drawings with a helpful bent page indicator in the lower right hand corner indicating the need to turn the page over to continue. Good thing, I never would have noticed it was printed on both sides! Step 12 indicates you need to turn the printer on. The final step indicates you insert the DVD into your laptop. If only laptops still had DVD readers. In my Apple world those are barely even remembered. So there we both sat in awkward silence.There is a tiny, single line display so I decided to break the ice and start pushing the few buttons there. It asked if I wanted to set it up using an app. Yes please. I downloaded the only Lexmark app I could find onto my phone, but that proved to be a dead end. I used my iMac to try to locate drivers for the B3340 and finally wading through microscopic online print and charts seemed to find what I needed so clicked the hyperlink for Mac. Nothing downloaded. I connected the printer to my desktop to see if that might make a love connection. I thankfully had the correct cable. Would have been nice if Lexmark had included one but maybe no one does that any more. Though others seem to make even a tiny effort to give you a modicum of direction. I opened my Printer preference tab, and by golly, it had recognized the new printer. Clicking on some options seemed promising but still no directions. I went back to that single line display and started clicking through and eventually found an option to connect to Wifi. It found my network thankfully and asked for my password. I hoped there might be a more handy input method. But no, you need to go through small a, capital A, small b capital B, etc. for each part of your password. Mine dutifully is 10 characters long so it was a lot of tapping. Eventually all was set up, and I directed the computer to print a page and selected the Lexmark. Thankfully it instantly printed the page, though the quality seemed a little light and non-crisp. Imagining there were internal adjustments I went back to single line display, but nothing there. In the mean time the printer went into sleep mode. I opened the Printer choices but nothing helpful there. After pushing the back arrow on the printer it said it was ""ready"" and fully awake. Thats when, in the Printer section under the ""general"" tab, there was a tiny box that said it would take you to the printer web site. I bit, and although it's not obvious at all, there are nests of settings that will adjust your printer, including print quality and darkness level. I made the adjustments, printed another page and the page was beautiful. I was interrupted but returned to make sure all was in order, tried to print another page but nothing. It said it couldn't find the printer. Ten minutes later, the page printed.Over all, this seems to be a solid relatively compact printer. It says it's made out of steel though the exterior seems like hard plastic. The single line of display gives basic information only after lots of clicking and little intuitive guidance. Once all is set up to the settings of your choice, it seems promising. I cancelled sleep mode but it still seems to doze off and not print wirelessly on command. I'll keep tinkering. In conclusion, unit build seems solid, compact and unencumbered by buttons and blinking lights. Five stars there. As for helpful setup directions or any guidance I would give it zero stars if possible. I believe this will prove to be a solid, reliable printer. As long as I don't need to wake it up by physically pushing a button on the controls, and the wifi proves reliable, I should be happy. If you're reading Lexmark, can't you simply include a second piece of printed instructions that gives a buyer even a scrap of guidance? At least for customers who exist in the Apple universe, or with Windows laptops that lack DVD access?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IL5WOCYEQBP6?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,0,0,No,
RG94MZQ2YVFD9,"April 17, 2020",LifeIsGood,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Great monochrome laser for the home/small office,"This is a compact, somewhat lightweight black & white laser printer. No scanner, fax, or copier. But as a printer it is excellent. Print speeds are fast at just about 1.5 seconds per page and the built-in duplexer is great. The instructions are just pictures, which can be a bit confusing, but once you have the printer out of the box they make more sense. This only comes with a power cable so if you're going to connect directly to a computer you will need a printer cable (that funky cable with a squarish connector). Because of all our devices we went with the wireless option for connectivity. The 2-line monochrome screen is used to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Again, no instructions. If you've set up a printer before this is not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that your network has to be 2G and not 5G. It does come with a CD but I prefer to download the latest from the manufacturer's website. This is a 100MB download for the full package. The Lexmark app installed fine on my Android tablet (Samsung) and I was able to print from there as well. This is a simple but very nice B&W laser that works well for any home office or even a small business office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG94MZQ2YVFD9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,0,0,No,

I often print reports, emails, etc and don't want to go to the larger network printer down the hall to retrieve them. A local desktop printer is the perfect solution and this was a great choice!What I Like:Lexmark brand has a great reputation for making quality printers. I expect to get several years of use from this unit.Print quality is excellent - as is expected from a laser printer.Print speed is also very good - large reports print nearly as quickly as the huge printer down the hall!Refill toner cartridge is reasonably priced - more so than toner for color printers.Can connect via wireless by connecting to local wifi network or directly via a USB or ethernet cable - nice to have several options - I opted for a direct cable connection from my PC.Really nice printer and very happy with it - highly recommend!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FA5UDTM6B1JD?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,0,0,No,

R39CAVAUFNIBMI,"March 13, 2020",Stepinwolf,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"It works with wired ethernet, has safety mark, poor instructions","I had a little trouble setting this up. The instructions are graphical so that they work all the different languages worldwide. The first steps go through getting it out of the box, removing all the shipping tape and padding, putting paper in it and the like. At step 12, it basically says turn it on. Then in step 13 there is a picture of the CD and an arrow to a laptop. My laptop doesn’t have a CD drive. So I tried using it on a desktop Windows 10 PC and it couldn’t find the printer. I assume there was a missing step somewhere that was to allow the printer to access my local WiFi network. Since I have a wired ethernet as well as WiFi, I chose to make a wired connection so that I could go to the next step in the setup program. It did find the printer and that allowed me to go further. I did have to do a bit of troubleshooting to actually get it to print. I got some error message about something (SMTP?) not being set up. I kept trying to print and I thought it still wasn’t working until I went to the room where the printer was located and found that it had been printing and double sided at that. I seem to remember it asking me at some point if I used the wireless app to set up the printer. Since I didn’t have a wireless app that I was aware of, I said no. Notice in the lower right corner of the instructions there is an I with arrow pointing to a WWW for I assume information. Does this mean, if you need help search the web? A web might be helpful. On plus side, the printer works fine, with good print quality. I assume that I will get the wireless part working at some point.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39CAVAUFNIBMI?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
