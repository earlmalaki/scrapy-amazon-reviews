RY11929L02OAT,"October 3, 2019",Orestes,1,N/A,Verified Purchase,15,2,Defective out of the box - poor warranty support,"This particular printer was defective when delivered. As soon as it was set up it was obvious that the print quality was very poor. After contacting Lexmark and sending examples and details (SN, proof of purchase etc) of the printer, the initial diagnosis was a faulty toner cartridge. A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience. Its possible that if you happen to get a working printer, it might serve you well. But don't count on much in the way of support from Lexmark if you happen to get a dud."
R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,4,N/A,Vine Customer,31,0,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended."
R218MLO8BAOX78,"November 8, 2019",MH,1,N/A,Verified Purchase,5,0,THIS PRINTER IS NOT USER FRIENDLY.,"The only things positive about a Lexmark MC3224adwe printer was its print quality and its physical construction (51 lbs). The printer was delivered without written support to setup this printer. Lexmark's online information is essentially meaningless. It was not only hard to understand, but it was vastly incomplete and misleading. After spending over 10 hours on the telephone with Lexmark's 3rd party contractor/support team, the technician got the printer to print properly. The technician could not get the scanner to function with the Lexmark information supplied to the 3rd party support team. The scanner worked after being ""jerry rigged"" by the technician with a non Lexmark product. Whoever designed Lexmark's software did not seem know what they were doing. The printer is built like a tank with the brain of a worm. I finally gave up and returned the printer to Amazon."

RCWVYCEA8V2JZ,"November 9, 2019",Vizoere,4,N/A,Verified Purchase,1,0,"Good value, weak wifi, a bit complicated","I finally got it set up and working properly. I'm able to print from my two Windows-based computers and from my android phone. Document quality is superb, but photo quality is mediocre. I expected that when buying a laser, so no points off.I had several problems setting it up, most of which I think are due to a weak wifi radio. The printer is on the opposite end of the house from my router with walls, cabinets, a refrigerator between them. That said, other devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc) work ok in this office.When turning on the printer for the first time, the screen showed a message telling me to go to a specific URL and download the Lexmark software for my mobile device to help set up the printer. I just went to the Google Play store and searched for Lexmark Mobile Assistant, and it came right up. Installed that and started the configuration. It seemed a bit complicated, but ended up working fine to configure the printer.Within the app, it suggested downloading the Lexmark printing app and the Lexmark print plugin. I did both and tried to print a picture from my phone. That's where the problems started. It would fail to connect, then connect ok long enough to send a print, then it couldn't connect anymore.I switched to setting up the Windows computers, downloaded the software from Lexmark (skipped using the CD, as they're usually out-of-date), and started the install. It couldn't locate the printer on the network, and after several tries using a couple of the options, I just clicked the Advanced button, typed in the IP address manually, and the install finished. Once that was finished, Windows could print and the printer spit out the paper with what I expected, but every time, I saw a message pop up that it couldn't connect to the printer.Eventually, after troubleshooting and searching Google, I decided to try plugging it in through an ethernet cable instead of worrying with wifi. After changing the Windows printer port to reflect the new IP address, I stopped getting the can't connect error. After deleting and re-adding the printer on my phone, it can now print as well.Overall, I'm happy with the printer, as it has the features I need for a reasonable price. As an IT person, I was able to work through the difficulties caused by the weak wifi radio, but I don't know that someone not familiar with networking would have been able to without assistance."

I’m on macOS and I was wary of a few negative reviews about the lack of Apple software for this unit, but I have a friend who is a Lexmark dealer and authorized repair center, so I thought it was worth the risk.It’s true that there is no Mac driver for this unit, but you don’t need it. Unpacking and setting up was easy… And using the free Lexmark iOS app to set up my Wi-Fi connection couldn’t have been simpler. My Mac Pro saw the printer instantly and I was up and running in two minutes.And while there is no Lexmark software to run this printer… I already owned VueScan, A third-party scanning software… And it runs this printer perfectly, including all of the options for resolution, flatbed scanning, document feeder scanning, and everything else. You can also access all of the printers options through your web browser by locating the printers address on your home network.So… Absolutely a joy to set up and use with my Mac Pro running Mojave."

Well a week after the call the support rep keeps telling me that the tracking numbers will be available in 2 days. This has been going on for about a week now and no tracking numbers. I am ready to return this unit to amazon and be done with this brand.

Both ethernet and wireless compatible, the technology allows you to set up the device according to your needs, even if you choose to print from your cellphone. You can scan, fax, and print. The color copies it makes are crisp and clear. At around 40 pounds, the printer can be moved if needed. It measures 13 inches high, 15 ½ inches wide, and 14 ½ inches deep, which makes it almost a square shape and capable of fitting in smaller spaces.A small control screen that is touch-enabled is located on the left front of the unit. The keypad that comes up is very touch-sensitive. I had to enter my long wireless information more than once in setting the printer up. The only negative I have encountered in using the printer is in the set-up. Instructions are clear and detailed for removing the clear tapes and plastic tabs, keeping the toner ink in place. You may need to chat online with a company representative as I did to ensure you have established connectivity to all your devices.You do have to download the printer driver which comes on a provided disc or from the given website. You will also need to enter your unique wireless information on your printer keypad if you are choosing this method. All in all, this was not a bad experience; the representative was very helpful and clear; however, the set-up process is not entirely intuitive.The printer functions beautifully.

RGN6CJJRKWO81,"August 6, 2019",Matthew R,5,N/A,Vine Customer,3,0,Color printer/photocopier.  600dpi with photo enhancement.  Wireless capable and fast.,"This is a nice compact color printer. It also allows you to scan, fax and copy. The printer can copy/scan/print in 600dpi but if you use the photo settings you can get results that look better than 600dpi. It will not produce the results you would expect from a photo printer but it can produce nice quality output if you use the right settings.The touch screen is also in color and is bright and clear. (you can see it at an angle easily as well) It is nice to scroll through the menus like you would on your smartphone. (touch and drag)The scanner seems to make images a little brighter and a more 'washed out' than the original in some cases. The software comes with a TWAIN-compliant driver that will let you import images into your favorite graphics manipulation program. (like Photoshop for example) I was able to scan photos with close to photo-quality output by selecting the Photo Mode from the menu of the TWIAN driver and changing the dpi setting to 600. The image looked better than 600dpi but it did scan in 600dpi. The full 8.5x11 sheet was 5100 x 6600 pixels. (if you divide the pixels by 600 it ends up being 8.5 x 11)For office or home use, it is a great little printer as long as you aren't expecting it to print photo quality. One nice thing about a laser printer is that it can sit of years without issues, unlike an inkjet where the ink can dry and cause issues if it is not used frequently.The printer was easy to install and comes with an actual CD/DVD. (you can find the driver on Epson's website very easily if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer) It can also be set up to print from a phone over WiFi. My experience with printing from a phone is that it is a last resort since the phone itself limits the control you have over the print output.In summary, the printer only prints in 600dpi but some kind of enhancement is going on that makes photos look better than 600dpi when it is used. Even with those settings, it does not with photo quality results. For graphics, text and even photo-like quality, it is a great all-around multifunction.The printer goes to sleep on its own after a bit so to use it wirelessly you may need to power it on. It can be used as a scanner though it can only scan at 600dpi. (photo mode enhances the image for photos) I haven't tried the fax functionality since I do not fax much. The copier functionality is slick. You can navigate through the menus to get the optimal settings.It does everything I would expect it to do. The photo enhancements from photo mode produced very nice results for 600dpi, even though the output is not photo quality. I printed a picture of my friend's Camaro on regular copy paper for reference."

They are not extremely heavy printers but tend to also need to do some occasional scanning, were interested in the idea of being able to fax medical paperwork when they can't upload in an app, and liked the idea of not having to replace ink continually. So we're in business with this printer.Hardware: Very well constructed, more durably made than your average HP or Canon these days.Packing: Very well packed in materials that did not get damaged nor have issues during shipping.Unpacking: Very easy to slide out of the box, no acrobatics requiredSetup: Setup is very easy. I used the menu rather than an app or installing things on a computerAfter setup and installing the local drivers and configuring them, the printer is very responsive for printing even though its allowed to sleep most of the time. It also works well with AirPrint which is fantastic!The LCD screen is bright, color, and easy to use. The touch buttons are also very easy to use. The functionality of the scanner, toner loading, other physical functions are easy. Double side printing is very easy.This was almost a 5 star review but there were a couple software issues that got in the way and I'm sure will be resolved with software updates.1. When setting up the fax, no matter how many times I named the fax, it wouldn't save. I had to skip it and do it later by navigating the menu.2. The printer for some reason came thinking it's main paper tray was ""colored paper"" which caused every single computer I set up to cause the printer to throw an error every time they tried to print to ""plain paper"" which is the default for every printer in the world forever and always for it's main paper tray-- I'd guess this was a setup bug/error.3. I cannot for the life of me get the software and driver for Windows 10 to recognize this model of printer to display a scanning utility. I'm expecting this to be solved by a software update as well. I know this printer was listed as ""just announced"" on the web site. The driver installs fine, I can print fine, but when I open the utility for scanning it says no compatible models found. Even Windows 10 recognizes the scanning device but...So summary: The printer is fantastic, I love it, I wouldn't hesitate on buying but only if scanning over the network is absolutely essential, and I'd guess that should be solved soon. I'll update if I know it's fixed in a software update."

R2S19CBIJT7PAR,"September 6, 2019",S,5,N/A,Vine Customer,1,0,"Solid, well-made printer","I got this Lexmark after my last printer died on me, and I’m pretty glad I did. It’s really well made, offers a ton of great features, and looks pretty good on my desk. While my needs for this printer aren’t many (I have another printer for my home office), it’s worked really well for me so far and I’d be happy to recommend it.Pros:When printing the black text shows up crisp and clear on the page, proving immediately that it’s a quality piece of equipment. It’s bold and punchy, and I haven’t had any trouble reading anything I’ve printed yet. The color printing for photos and images is pretty good, though I’ve seen much better from other printers. It’ll work just fine as long as printing color isn’t your main objective. After setup, the printer easily connects to my devices (Macbook, Android) without fail, and I’ve absolutely never had a problem.I love that the printer is so quiet - it doesn’t even wake my sleeping pets when they’re in the same room! The scanning feature is pretty easy to use and self explanatory with a regular speed. The small touchscreen is easy to use and lends a modern feel to the machine. Everything on the machine is high quality, and it feels like it’s made to last. Nothing flimsy whatsoever.Cons:As mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t recommend this printer if photos and color-use are your main objectives. While the printer works fine for these things, the vibrance is notably less than for my previous printer (Epson Workforce Pro WF-4630). This feels nitpicky, but I’d really have expected a larger paper tray from a printer of this size and price.Setup took a little longer than I’d prefer - you have to install a driver and painstakingly connect the printer to all your devices. Again, once setup, you’re good to go, but know that you’ll be sitting down for a good half hour or so to get it all working. For home use, I find the printer size a bit much. It appears to me a little smaller in the photos, so I was surprised when it arrived and I had to find a bigger spot for it.Overall, though, it’s a pretty good product. I’d happy suggest it."
R8G8VXYIKS23K,"July 31, 2019",Dice,4,N/A,Vine Customer,1,0,Quality and Feature Packed,"This printer is replacing an inkjet in a small home office that primarily prints word documents and the rare color image. This Lexmark has so far fit the bill well with it compact size, quiet operation, and fast printing capability. There are many features packed into this printer, all of which is controlled on the almost over-sensitive touch screen (perhaps my fingers are just too big). Setup was fairly straightforward for me and I didn't need any assistance. Wired and wireless connections work very well and I have had zero problems with wireless connections.Print quality is excellent for text, and so-so for images. However, if you are looking to print quality images, that is where an inkjet will still be handy. For that reason, my old inkjet will stick around strictly for printing images.Lexmark also offers an exchange program for their toner cartridges, saving the consumer about 25%. You purchase a toner cartridge from Lexmark, in exchange for your old one. However, it appears that of the time of this review, it is currently unavailable.Overall, for a home, or even office, this is an excellent printer. Even if you don't print often at all, but need the printer to work at the snap of your fingers, I would suggest this laser printer over an inkjet because unlike ink, toner won't dry out and become waste. You will pay the price upfront, but over the life of the printer, you will more than make up for the cost in the long run."
R3CD0J7QEKBDGC,"August 15, 2019",M. L. Thompson,5,N/A,Vine Customer,1,0,"Fast, good quality, and good value for cost","I’ve been really pleased with this printer. One advantage to a laser is that it is fairly quiet while still printing high volumes of pages. This particular model was very easy to set up to print from a variety of sources—including Airprint, Google Cloud Print, the Lexmark Apple app on an iPhone and/or iPad, and a network printer from a Windows PC. Resolution on the type or font is good, making the print quality excellent. The only slight drawback I noticed was that it doesn’t offer a huge number of options directly from the print screen to customize print jobs. I did not deduct any stars for this because it meets the needs of our household well, regardless."
RL0H4QID63JQB,"September 6, 2019",Mido,5,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,Great printer & copier,"This is a great color printer. Fast, good colors. It's similar to an HP I also have (m454). Large toner cartridges. Good color. The color is great for anything other than photos... there is looks good, but it looks like a ""copy"", though that's partially because of the paper. If you copy or print anything that's more like diagrams or line art, the colors are great. Set up was smooth -- not quite as easy at the HP, but nothing to complain about. Print time and sound are similar to the HP. The HP is a little quieter. But since this has a scanner also, for copying, unless you only need the printer, this is a better buy than the HP."
R27A3J0254FLG6,"September 3, 2019",Angela,4,N/A,Vine Customer,1,0,Works great once it is finally up an running correctly,Printing pictures or documents from your phone app works great over wifi. Printing off the computer through their webpage was horrible. There are no instructions telling you what to do and only now after weeks of trying I was finally able to get it to print from the computer. The scan and print option/photocopy option is great. Photocopies in color as well which is nice.
R3W28I1V7LYNG2,"August 18, 2019",CHEezyMom,5,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,Great printer,"It’s a bit on the large side for home use but only because it’s tall. As far as desk space it takes up the same amount as our old all-in-one. This printer works great. Easy to use and connect. Prints clearly and fast. The only con so far is that when scanning and making copies it comes out lighter than what I’d like it to but It’s still clear. Printing wirelessly from our laptop to this works fine, no issues."
RJK1DEBRDB1ZB,"February 23, 2020",Edwin Combs,5,N/A,Unverified,0,0,I own this printer and so far it works great,"I own this printer and the print quality is very good. I use it as a home printer/scanner/copier. I was going to buy an eco-tank Epson, but I go long periods without printing and inkjets get clogged nozzles. So far with this printer, I have no complaints. Toner is expensive, but in time there will be a cheaper third party alternative."
R3FHV47UX4SZBR,"January 30, 2020",Bargn Hntr,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,So much better than the Canon ImageCLASS,OMG I don’t know why I ever bought Canons. The set up was easy and it stays connected without giving me errors every week and having to be reset like my Canons. The print speed is as good or better than my Canon ImageCLASS MF642Cdw. For me I would not switch back to the Canons this is affordable and is much more dependable
R2CMB00FIQ051K,"September 9, 2019",Alison L,5,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,Quality and convenient,Great printer. The set up process was fairly simple. None of our computers have DVD drive so we weren’t able to use the included disk and had to set it up using the touch screen. The app is easy to use and I love being able to print from my phone. We really like the double sided printing option. It does great quality prints.
R12L2QIHXNUM15,"August 12, 2019",Jalicia,4,N/A,Vine Customer,0,0,Nice,It's great just a little hard to set up you gotta download like 3 apps. Wish I could use glossy paper for pictures
