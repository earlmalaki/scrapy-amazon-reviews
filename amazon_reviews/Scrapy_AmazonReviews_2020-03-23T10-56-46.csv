I bought it because I don't print all that often and was tired of my cartridges drying up in my inkjet printer.

What good is a printer that prints excellent pictures but constantly disconnects from your devices when you need it?! It was constantly offline.

STILL ON THE HUNT...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JVYG5FC41HPF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"UPDATE 3.21.20I went to print on the printer for the second time since printing after set up the first day I opened this printer. I saw the same problem as I did with my previous printer. The print quality is splotchy and blurry. Part of the page didn't even print. I tried darkening the toner in the settings - same issue, no difference. I tried doing a test print - even the test print was splotchy and not clear but the very last page said no issues with cartridge. Amazon customer service said try replacing the toner (which would have cost me HUNDREDS of dollars) which was ridiculous. I am still on the hunt for just a decent printer...I am starting to question if there are any good printers out there any more.I tried another brand before this and was an awful experience printing and trying to return it. I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this. Not enough to send back because the printer is so quick and sharp, but a bit annoyed my colors on the screen won't come out on the page exactly. I hope this review helps someone."

I am so disappointed. Beyond that, I would also add that after yet another 2 hour telephone call to Lexmark yesterday, I have yet to receive the promised return communication from a more advanced tech. Lexmark? Really? You can do better. If there were lemon laws for printers, this one would definitely qualify as a lemon."

We are incredibly pleased with it. Since it arrived and we set it up--which was simple for my husband but he is an IT guy so consider that--we've used it a ton. Probably a good two reams of paper and we've been satisfied with it all.It is an incredibly quick printer and scanner. The print quality is great and the ink never bleeds. I've enjoyed using this printer with my crafts, specifically my waterslide decals, because the laser ink doesn't need to be sealed and doesn't bleed under moisture. It dries quickly and applies precisely.Scanning setup took a bit more effort for me (husband wasn't home) but I got it up and running just fine by myself. The menu is color and so far has worked well, I have no problem operating this printer at all. My multiple devices have paired with it great.As far as laser printers go, and this one also being a color printer, this is an excellent choice for a home or small business printer! I would absolutely recommend it without reservations at this point. Of course, if anything changes I'll update this review accordingly."

Prints very fast (Better than my current printer which takes close to 30 seconds to print).Using for it past few months to print personal as well as office related work, so far no issues. The machine came with starter toner with very less ink. Toners are pretty expensive for this printer, costing me close to $75 for each toner.Overall, printer with lot of features but costly toners."

Mac users, use it in Catalina iOS 10.15 for sure get this printer you'll be doing yourself a great favor. Set up easy. I set it up in 15min's this is no BS. I love this printer best I ever had.The last printer I paid 350.00 lost it all nothing but problems, Samsung sold to HP. I worked in IT always calling support. When Apple went to iOS 10.15 I could not print at all. I toss the printer out the window pissed off. The best thing I did was get this Lexmart MC3224dwe so easy to use. Quality of the print is great!! Scanning very easy great Quality!! So happy Yahoo!!!! By the way you can tell the printer is made with grate Quality, it's not cheap, light and plastic, it's made heavy and you can tell it's made solid steel."

Had I know this, I would have picked a different all-in-one. That being said, I like how this one prints and the fact that it prints double sided. It is also easy to make copies. Update 2/27/20 I figured out that this will scan to your local PC if you use Windows Fax and Scan. Also, there are some open source software scanners that will also allow you to scan on your local PC. I am using NAPS2 and it works great with this."

I tried to look at their website but it's just the same video on how to remove a sticker, etc. I am not ignorant about computers and technology but again, the set-up for this printer is ridiculous.

There is no USB port to print to and for scanning you have to open an application even though the printer key pad option actually have a scan prompt cability. When you use that function, it gives you a hard copy of the document. The technical support team lacks the knowledge about the printer functionalities. In fact when they cannot answer a practical question they lie instead. One tech by the name Yury Alexandra Espinosa Piratoba was very dishonest about calling me back.... still waiting. The case number she gave to me does not exit according to another tech support member. The chat request gives an error after submitting"
