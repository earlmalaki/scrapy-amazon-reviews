R16KJZQTOTLVJC,"July 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,1,MC3326adwe,Verified Purchase,toner costs more than the printer,"I print a lot, and I knew that I would be changing out an ink cartridge every week at the rate I print. I wanted a color printer since I do print documents and articles with color prints and images. Instead of an inkjet I decided to buy this laser printer, anticipating it would be cheaper in the long run than inkjet. I was wrong. After the 2nd week of having it I ran out of black toner which the printer informed me was low. I ordered the toner ($90 by the way), you have to order it since it is not sold in stores, (tried staples, best buy, office max, walmart, target, costco, etc). After the toner arrived I installed it and tried to print but it would not print since now the color toners were out. It did not mention that. I thought ok, I will only print in black and white or grayscale until I can get the color toner replaced. NOPE it will not print if any toner is out. I look up the color toner to purchase and it cost $100 MORE than the printer cost!!! I should have looked at that before buying the printer but I did not expect it to be so expensive. It is now a VERY expensive paperweight, as I refuse to pay more for my toner than for my printer. I ended up buying an inkjet, and although I will probably spend more money in the long run, I live paycheck to paycheck, I can purchase a $30 ink cartridge here and there, I can not drop $350 all at one time for toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KJZQTOTLVJC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,3,0,No,

R1ZJ5A8AGR4EJF,"January 29, 2020",Teresa (ohio),1,MC3326adwe,Unverified,Run!,"This printer is nothing but trouble. It is not user friendly. Our tech provider, along with certified Lexmark techs and I have spent countless man hours trying to get this printer to work correctly and have gotten nowhere. The airprint still doesn't work...at all...and the scanning feature is not working either. I would advise anyone considering purchasing this Lexmark to save your money and look elsewhere. I am so disappointed. Beyond that, I would also add that after yet another 2 hour telephone call to Lexmark yesterday, I have yet to receive the promised return communication from a more advanced tech. Lexmark? Really? You can do better. If there were lemon laws for printers, this one would definitely qualify as a lemon.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZJ5A8AGR4EJF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,2,0,No,
RQ267Y8YK5H6I,"January 20, 2020",Anthony Melton,5,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,This is now my main printer,I have owned dozens of printers and this is the one I have chosen as my constantly on home printer. Anything other than photos are printed on this printer. Not that it does not print a decent photo but I have a much more expensive professional printer just for photos. I like everything about this printer and it is my current top choice for a home printer. It is dependable and as long as I keep paper in it I can count on it to print whatever I send to it. An absolute recommendation.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ267Y8YK5H6I?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,1,0,No,
