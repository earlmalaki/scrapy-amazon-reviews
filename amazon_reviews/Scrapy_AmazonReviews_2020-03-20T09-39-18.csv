It is not user friendly. Our tech provider, along with certified Lexmark techs and I have spent countless man hours trying to get this printer to work correctly and have gotten nowhere. The airprint still doesn't work...at all...and the scanning feature is not working either. I would advise anyone considering purchasing this Lexmark to save your money and look elsewhere. I am so disappointed. Beyond that, I would also add that after yet another 2 hour telephone call to Lexmark yesterday, I have yet to receive the promised return communication from a more advanced tech. Lexmark? Really? You can do better. If there were lemon laws for printers, this one would definitely qualify as a lemon."

We are incredibly pleased with it. Since it arrived and we set it up--which was simple for my husband but he is an IT guy so consider that--we've used it a ton. Probably a good two reams of paper and we've been satisfied with it all.It is an incredibly quick printer and scanner. The print quality is great and the ink never bleeds. I've enjoyed using this printer with my crafts, specifically my waterslide decals, because the laser ink doesn't need to be sealed and doesn't bleed under moisture. It dries quickly and applies precisely.Scanning setup took a bit more effort for me (husband wasn't home) but I got it up and running just fine by myself. The menu is color and so far has worked well, I have no problem operating this printer at all. My multiple devices have paired with it great.As far as laser printers go, and this one also being a color printer, this is an excellent choice for a home or small business printer! I would absolutely recommend it without reservations at this point. Of course, if anything changes I'll update this review accordingly."

Those days are long gone and I don't miss them. I plugged this in. Connected it to my wife's tablet. It worked. Heck, before we did that, I had to run a copy of something real quick. I had already plugged it in, so I just hit the copy button after feeding what we needed into the right slot. That worked.So, yeah, there's more to it than that. We set up the printer on the WIFI at home. I used the interface directly on the printer. It was easy, quick and intuitive. I had no more finished when my machine beeped. It had recognized the printer and had already negotiated my machine to have access to it.The only work involved was getting the scanning software set up on my wife's machine and then getting her to act as the scan recipient (my machine had assumed that job). It was maybe, five minutes, max.The quality of the prints are good. The noise factor is low. The speed is adequate for a small family and a work-out-of-the-house business. Scans are accurate. Copies are accurate. The entire thing is just working, right out of the box with minimal setup or labor. So much better than the old days."

The price on the replacement ink is enough to buy another printer AND more. There are four different toners that would need replacement. In terms of the setup, it's not too difficult to setup just standard printing and copying. However, the scanning feature is a joke. You can scan to e-mail or scan to a USB. I did not find anywhere that would allow you to scan to your PC, the most basic functionality that would make scanning make sense. The document feeder works fine and wireless was easy to set up.This unit is quite heavy. The printing is decently fast but I've only used it for printing black and white so far. I've seen better, honestly, and with the price point, I expected slightly more."

The settings can not be changed from default, so the only option is to scan as either JPG or TIFF [Welcome back to 2005]. There is no software that installs with the printer making any setup that much harder. The instructions are non-existent, even if you can find something online. If you need functionality that should be common on any printer still on the market, skip this one and go with something newer. Shame on the vendor for not posting the age of the printer, which I found out later was last manufactured in 2015.Note: I called Lexmark tech support to attempt to get the scan setup working, and 1 hour later they still had no clue and gave up.

R291OJN6PJCTIT,"September 18, 2019",J.

Typically most people don't use a laser printer at home because the replacement toner is so crazy expensive, but this isn't enough printer for a huge office either. Maybe a very small business, even a home business? It definitely yields very professional results.It took me a little while to get it set up, as I don't have a disc drive (it comes with an install disc, but for some of us that's not helpful). The enclosed instructions were not very helpful, and the on-board touchscreen wanted me to set it up for mobile using my phone, then did not provide the correct QR code or series of numbers for me to get it working. Finally I did a manual driver search using my computer's install-printer settings. Even that was a little more complex than usual because it wanted me to enter the printer's IP address manually; fortunately that number WAS on the little touchscreen, and after that it was smooth sailing.After the minor hiccups of setting it up, it worked fast and extremely well! I needed to print a full-color comic book page onto cardstock right away, and it spat it out in about 10 seconds looking absolutely perfect. I understand I'll run out of toner in about a week if I make that a habit, but it is nice to have that capability when I need it! So far it has printed very crisp, professional looking documents, and the full color prints have been absolutely flawless.It is a little larger than my inkjet (which admittedly is a big, multi-function inkjet) and it is A LOT HEAVIER. So be sure you have a good printer stand for it, because it needs it's own place. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone and everyone for home use, as it is a whole lot of printer for just the occasional job. But if you need excellent quality printing and are able to pay for supplies, this is a very solid model."
R1CNBRTS6Y639V,"September 16, 2019",Dave Cunningham,Vine Customer,2,MC3326adwe,N/A,0,0,No,Mediocre office printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CNBRTS6Y639V?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,,"The main reasons this Lexmark doesn't get high marks from me: the setup is not as quick and easy as other printers I've had, and the color printing is only mediocre. I sometimes print photos and images on blank DVD disks, and I love that my Canon printer can do that in a very high-quality way. This Lexmark, not so much. Also, it's considerably larger than my Canon.It does spit out pages fairly quickly, about one every 3 seconds, and if you just need black and white document copies, this is a good printer for that. It's really best suited for office work.Another downside is that the toner is quite expensive. I was hoping to find a generic toner that would be compatible, but apparently none such exists yet. I know people who much prefer laser printers to inkjet, and perhaps it will last longer than my Canon inkjet printer -- I have gone through three inkjets in the last eight years -- but I still prefer the nice quality color printing of an inkjet."

Out of the box, this was easy to set up and pretty quick. I did install an app on my phone which made getting it going pretty easy.So far, I'm able to print and the prints are great - both black and white and color turn out great. It is a tad louder than our inkjet, but the print quality is so clear! And no smearing.Another plus is the paper capacity. Our old printer had to be reloaded often, with a paper tray that holds 250My biggest concern is the cost of replacement toner, but honestly, it might be cheaper in the long run. To keep my last printer going (kind of - with murky prints) I had to replace a maintenance box twice, so the costs were adding up.At the time of writing this, it looks like there is a black toner cartridge return program that costs $85 for the black toner, making the black replacement a little less than 1/2 the cost of the printer itself - so it might just be cheaper to purchase an all-new printer when this one runs out of toner, or at least two colors."

No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem. The printer has a noise level when printing (and did quiet when not) however, its not much different from the Brother laser printer it replaced and is less noisy than an ink jet. For its price point and functionality - it is no problem."

R2QGCPEHD3BGXH,"August 15, 2019",Dora Explorer,Vine Customer,4,MC3326adwe,N/A,3,1,No,Great printer for small business or a busy household,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGCPEHD3BGXH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,,"I'll start by saying that we are using this printer at home.*PrintingThe printer starts up and prints very quickly, even from being fully asleep. Black and white print quality is very good. The text is very crisp and dark. Color printing is great for say printing web pages and colorful items such as that. For pictures it‚Äôs passable, but it‚Äôs not the kind of stuff you are going to print out and put into a picture frame. As long as you are printing on the front of the page only it spits the pages out very fast. If you do two sided it has to suck the page back into the printer which takes much longer. All printers that do duplex do this, so this is not specific to this printer though.We have had the printer be picky about the paper it picks up. There was one certain batch of paper (and we do not remember where it came from, sorry) that it had trouble picking up and jammed once and printed crooked on the rest. Everything else we have fed it has been fine.*ScanningThe scanning seems to be pretty good. The automatic document feeder is a very nice feature, and is something we considered essential ‚Äì I‚Äôm too old to stand there and swap pages manually.Another nice thing about the scanner is that it functions on its own. Some lesser printers require software on a computer and the devices have to be connected and all that in order to scan things. This is a pain and never works well for me. With the Lexmark printer though, you can email the scan jobs and as long as you have the email server set up it requires no computer or additional setup.It‚Äôs not immediately obvious, but if you set up what the printer calls a shortcut, that‚Äôs basically the address book for the scanner. Also, this is 10x easier to set up if you go to the web page of the printer. It can be done from the front panel but typing on the keyboard is a little painful. Just go to the IP of the printer in your web browser and you can set that up much easier.*Software and DriversThere is also an app that helps you set up wireless and such for the printer. It wasn‚Äôt great but it got the job done, just follow the instructions.We have android phones and used the android print plugin. It has low ratings in the play store, but for us it worked well without any issues at all.The latest version of windows 10 found the printer but did not have a driver to print with. If you go to the Lexmark website and type in the printer name, there‚Äôs a small download that will install drivers and find the printer and everything seems to work OK.For a mac, I was a little concerned when there wasn‚Äôt any mac version of the printer driver to download at first. When I tried to add it anyway I realized that the printer speaks airprint/bonjour and the printer was immediately found and added with no drama whatsoever.*Aesthetics/Fit and finishThe printer is a decent sized one, it‚Äôs bigger than most consumer printers, but it‚Äôs not huge. It feels well built and does not feel cheap or flimsy.The screen is touch and works very well, with intuitive menus and plenty of options. When you are using the keyboard things get a little tedious, but it does work and works well enough to actually use.The paper tray holds a fair amount of paper, and a nice feature is the printer knows how much paper is in the tray and when you look at ‚Äúsupplies‚Äù under the printer driver or in the web page, it will give you a useful indicator of the amount of paper."

This printer is about the same size as my old inkjet, but it is a bit heavier. I think the extra weight must equate to extra quality, because this printer is superior to every printer that I have ever owned. The setup instructions were a numbered set of pictures to follow. Once it was unboxed and plugged in, I simply turned it on and followed the on screen instructions. After connecting to my network, I could print from my iPhone or computer, and I didn‚Äôt have to download or install drivers. Everything it does is effortless and fast, and I love that there are no lights showing when it‚Äôs in ‚Äúsleep mode.‚Äù"
R21NOJFP9M5O7L,"August 2, 2019",Shane O. Laake,Vine Customer,5,MC3326adwe,N/A,4,0,No,Rather compact and very capable for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21NOJFP9M5O7L?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,,"The box that the unit shipped in was rather large, though when you remove the foam padding and consider that this is a color laser all in one with duplexing and a sheet feeder, it's rather compact. Setup starts with removing from the aforementioned foam, removing a large bag, and removing a bunch of tear away strips. Note there are pull tabs on all of the toner cartridges as well.Software setup can be completed via an app on your phone, but not if you're rocking the ethernet (which I prefer). Web download of the latest drive is a bit of a pain, as Lexmark uses the whole separate support page vs sales page strategy. The latter comes up first in any searches, but clicking support dumps you at the main support page. Boo! Once you find the software/drivers, it's also a bit of a miss, as I needed to specify my OS and 32/64 bitness, which is very 2009, and not 2019.That aside, the software installed easily, and it defaulted to not sending info back to lexmark--kudos! This thing prints crazy fast--go back to the last sentence and read this thing prints, and that's how long it took to do a full color portrait. Granted this isn't a photo printer, but it'll meet every need short of that expectation. My last home color laser was an OG four pass model, so this is such a revelation! The quality of print is also equal to the task.I don't do a lot of scanning, but it does a solid job, and the feeder is greatly appreciated (the limited scanning I do tends to be multipages documents I've signed). I haven't (and won't) use the fax. Copies are quite snappy!All in all, I love this printer. So much nicer than any inkjet! Toner doesn't bleed, and it's so fast. I haven't used this one enough to speak to reliability, but for now, assume it's spot on (I'll update if/when it isn't).Highly recommended"
RTK9V316GMLB3,"July 31, 2019",Scott McElhiney,Vine Customer,4,MC3326adwe,N/A,5,0,No,"Good quality, check out cost of replacement toner",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTK9V316GMLB3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,,"This was super easy to setup, I followed the pictures in the instructions for removing all the tape strips etc... plugged it in and used the USB to my desktop. Didn't need that though as it also setup the wifi to my network via the keyboard (could have used a mobile app on my phone), with me just pushing the button on my cable router and it found it and made a secure connection in seconds. Probably the second thing I've ever had connect where I didn't have to go through punching in a long password with correct capital letters and is that a 1 or a i or an L? I printed a test page and it did it fast and very high quality. Then I took one of my photographic pieces of artwork and laid it in the scanner bed and copied it. The only dramatic difference I see between the professional print and the copy is due to using paper that is more like parchment so I have texture rather than a glossy print. I don't believe anyone would purchase this for printing artwork, but in a pinch it'll due without leaving a horribly colored print with lines.It's size is what one would expect from a modern all in one... this is substantial, but not an office printer for those collating hundreds of copies of large documents at a time. Only one drawer for paper, so changing paper type will involve removing and reloading with whatever you need.It does two sided duplex printing automatically, so you don't have to reload paper, that is a nice feature. And you can send stuff to this pretty much any way imaginable, wi-fi, usb, ethernet, including through a few apps from your Apple or Android products.It also still includes FAX capability, something I haven't tried out because I haven't had a landline in years. It can email scans to your devices which I suspect will get used a lot more than the FAX machine part, but if you are in a business that still sends or recieves faxes, just plug in and it asks for the business name and phone number to configure itself. If you run a small office, that has a land line, I know that people pay for that when they NEED to send something by fax, so a potential profit center.The only downside I see to this is the cost of supplies. If you buy the cartridges for 2500 color copies from Lexmark with their return program supplies, it's $99.99 per color cartridge and there are three of those. 3000 pages for the black cartridge and it's $96.99. Their website shows them all on backorder, so hopefully as this printer penetrates the market, the price of supplies drops and availability increases.Given the choice between brands, the only one in the modern market I do not like is the one that times out it's supplies and lacks good support... and that isn't this. I've had good luck with Lexmark products in the past and this looks like a contender, just compare cost of supplies before jumping in."

RJI0VX8V39ZGZ,"July 31, 2019",Summit,Vine Customer,1,C3326dw,N/A,10,1,Yes,Built like a tank & fast,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJI0VX8V39ZGZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,Thanks for taking the time to review your Lexmark C3326dw Color Laser Printer. We‚Äôre sorry to hear you are having print quality issues and want to help you fix it quickly and easily. We‚Äôve already entered a service request on your behalf to speed things up. Just contact Lexmark Technical Support at 1-800-LEXMARK and ask the agent to reference SR 1-310 946 754 872. We look forward to hearing from you.,"I'm no stranger to laser printers- I worked my way through the I.T. industry, starting as the 'computer guy' who would come to your office to make your computers function- often elbows deep in a laser printer. Lexmark was originally a part of IBM and was separated in 1991 to be its own thing, but IBM is the go-to company for business class machines- it's even part of their name. The Lexmark printers are well known to business computing people, but probably less known to people who don't work in the computer biz and home users. Their products tend to be built to take a beating and this printer is no exception.One thing that stood out was the steel frame. It's a heavy, industrial quality machine. There isn't any ""fluff"" on it like many printers have- like touch screens and stylistic design. It's simple. The toner tray is unique and the paper tray is more simple than many- but that simplicity makes it durable. The tray latches in with a confident feel. By comparison, my HP color laser has a loose fitting, sloppy paper tray.I don't want more apps on my phone, so I configured this using the super simple little screen and buttons. The longest part was entering the password for the 2.4G network (it isn't compatible with the 5G network, boo...) but despite the simple buttons, it didn't take long as it quickly scrolls through letters and numbers. It connected instantly. I installed the whole software and driver package from the web site and noticed there is a new firmware upgrade as of a couple weeks ago- so I will apply that soon. The web site linked to the icon Lexmark places in their Windows software doesn't work. In fact, I can only bring up the printer settings when printing something- the printer control panel doesn't work any other way. One can also directly connect to the printer's web interface by simply putting the printer IP in a browser window. This is also how one updates the firmware once downloaded.Now, here's where things went a little strange. The printing I get is VERY fast and black and white prints are crisp. It defaults to printing both sides, which is annoying so I have to change settings. Color prints on mine are terrible, but since nobody else is reporting this problem I'm guessing it's because the delivery person tossed this in my driveway. I heard it hit the ground from inside the house. Packaging was minimal- the inside box has the molded foam around the printer but there was no padding between that box and the shipping box. I'll be looking into the problem more after the firmware update but the blue cartridge may be the issue. Printing various solid colors, the blue is extremely blotchy although no sign of toner leakage or damage to the cartridge. Until that is resolved, the color printing on this is extremely poor. Despite the color issue, the grainy appearance when printing a photo quality source is not nearly as good as my 6 year old HP color laser. For now, I'm only taking a star off for the wonky interface and the lousy software. Lexmark has always had wonky interfaces, but they make awesome business class printers. The printing issue on mine appears to be an anomaly and I'll update as I look to resolve it.*** update. all printing is blotchy to the point I can't even use the prints for draft working copies. I've gone through everything possible to attempt to resolve it to no avail. Not looking forward to having to deal with warranty and tech support- but I'll go through all that when I can find extra time to kill.****Second update. After trying a few basic things to try to reset the printer, it has failed to the point where it is now just a waste of space in my house. Warranty? Good luck with that. It was probably damaged when the USPS delivery involved throwing it in my driveway. Dropping off at the recycling depot today where I'll have to PAY to get rid of it."

Super easy to set up the WiFi, and to replace the toner cartridges. The paper is fast and easy to load, which I feel is important as well. So far no jams, but you really need to fan the paper before you load it. As to how long the toner lasts, I don't know, but there are ink saving settings if that is a concern of yours.

Super easy to set up -- it was operating in under five minutes! Fast, clean printing, too. I also installed the software on my laptop, allowing me to print wirelessly from anywhere in the house. Then I installed the printer app on my mobile phone (that took a few minutes to figure out, but once it configured it works great).I'm very pleased with how fast the printer starts printing once I send a document -- it's literally just a few seconds. And again, the printing is clean and clear, both B&W and color. Printer tray holds 250 sheets, which is average for most of today's printers. I'd love if it would hold an entire ream, but if that's my only complaint, I have no real complaint.I used an Okidata C5200 laser printer for more than a decade and it performed GREAT. So after it finally gave up the ghost I bought another Oki, but I was very disappointed. I've since tried Brother and HP, but for color printing, this Lexmark seems to have all its ducks in a row. It performs soundly and does NOT sound or feel cheap. I'm pleased as punch and because of its solid build, my impression is that it's going to last a long time. I'm giving it five solid stars."

One was a toner printer and the other an inkjet. In comparison, this laser printer is much faster and prints a higher quality image. Also, the color quality is far more consistent than with my ink jet. Its size is similar to the other two but this is far heavier. My postal service carrier had to get my husband to carry it for her. It is also much noiser than the other two, by a lot! Setup took me about 30 minutes. It was not plug-n-play by any means. I am not computer savvy so this may be easier for other people. My network found the printer immediately however, it said the driver was not working. My computer showed the correct driver was installed but would not connect the two. I tried downloading the driver from Lexmark's website but could not find one comparable with windows 10. Eventually, I used the set up disk included with the printer and it worked. Inconvinent if, like me, your computer does not have a disc drive.For my phone, I had to download the lexmark app for it connect to the printer. I'm not sure if there is a way to use it from my android without the app; this was simply the easiest way I could find to get it up and running. It does require the print jobs to pass over other networks on the way to the printer. Not the most effective or secure way to print.Update: the printer is constantly coming offline. I called customer support about the issue. Explaining that I was trying to print from my smartphone, customer support said they needed access to my laptop to diagnose the problem. After screen sharing, he opened the admin log reports for my entire computer and said the issue was with the error reports I had not addressed. Mind you, these reports were for my computer, not the printer and included things like a crash report for my office software. Customer support then said the only way to fix the printer was for me to pay one of their techs to fix the log report on my computer. What?! What is customer support for if they don't trouble shoot AND help fix the issue? The gentleman was rude in his reply and told me if I didn't want to pay that was my decision. Then he hung up. Umm okay. I have put my old reliable printer back up. At least the customer service with my other printer brand is helpful and the machine works, even if it is ancient."

This replacement printer is FASTER, SMALLER, and QUIETER than what it's replacing-- which was an HP CP2025.It was very well boxed for shipping, unpacked easily, was not damaged in shipping and nothing had moved around.Unpacking is easy. It slid out easily and the protective materials over the toners was easier to remove than most printers. The tape was minimal and I was on my way in no time.Setup was a breeze. It asks several questions when you turn it on to set date, time, location and to clarify whether you want to set it up with a mobile phone app or not. Easy.Windows recognized it easily as did my iPhone (AirPrint compatible!) and I didn't need to break into the book included, nor the CD that came with the driver. It couldn't have been more painless to unbox and install.Using it is also a breeze. It's much quieter than my former HP when idling, goes to sleep and wakes up faster and does the job without any paper jamming nor complaints.The only part that has taken a tiny bit of getting used to has been the single paper tray. part used for things like labels or envelopes. It works very well. It prints on thicker media very fast compared to my HP, but I do miss a bit of a wing to prop up heavier, floppier or thicker singles of paper. They never fall out and the printer seems to grip on them right way, so there is no deficiency here, just difference.The thing is super attractive to look at, does everything I need it to with expediency, and while it's a full 10 years more youthful than my HP, it seems to be better built.The place where I work uses Lexmark for their most challenging, difficult environments and for the most complex print jobs like GLM printing, and they hold up. I'm really happy with this printer and I trust it will do very well for me for a long time."
R3758P32NJSX0K,"July 21, 2019",dnkb,Vine Customer,4,C3326dw,N/A,7,0,No,Ultra-fast and sleek; app needs work,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3758P32NJSX0K?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,,"I'm used to boring ink-jet printers. They are nearly reliable (except when they break, run out of ink, mysteriously stop responding to commands like ""PRINT""...etc.) and slow and steady. Did I mention slow?So I was pretty thrilled to installer this Lexmark Color Laser Printer. A million years ago, when laser printers first came out (and my pet dinosaur roamed the earth), I remember how clean and crisp the printing appeared on the page . Only large institutions could afford laser printers way back then. Now ordinary mortals can.Now: the printer was easy to install. There's a cool little pamphlet with pictures detailing the instructions--no words! If you can follow the pictures, you're all set. The pictures even tell you what's recyclable. Awesome. However, there's a bar-code scanner for your phone to register the printer--decided to register the printer by phone on the spur of the moment. And some of the choices were a bit fuzzy; it asked for country and there was no place to CHOOSE my country. Things like that. More about the phone app in a second.Once the printer was installed, the Lexmark was MAGICAL. It printed in seconds flat. It took three seconds to print a full color print--crisp, beautiful. The printing for a full page was clean, no bleeding from the edges, and all the words were black and fine. The speed was astounding.However, the android app was really needs improvement. Some people do tons of printing from their phones nowadays, and if you do, you may have a problem with this app. First of all, the photos didn't print in color from my phone. They all printed in black-and-white. Lovely black-and-white, but they ARE color photos. Also, I can't print document from phone (only photo, camera, web page or clipboard). It would be great to be able to print a PDF or Word doc., for example, but it does not seem possible from the phone app. Granted, I did not try to troubleshoot at all. But I would really prefer that these kinks had been worked out before putting the app out to the public, because I'd like to have these capabilities at my fingertips immediately.The printer itself is terrific. I love it--it's fast and the printing is gorgeous. However, the app needs some work."

For this unit I‚Äôm going Wi-Fi.Power on asks if you want to set up via a mobile device, which directs you to the Lexmark Mobile Assistant app on your phone (I had to go install it). Using that app, you set up via Wi-Fi direct by finding the printer in your Wi-Fi connections and connecting (temporarily) to it.It will then search for wireless networks. It quickly found my 2.4 GHz network (not my 5 GHz). Typed in my password and we were done.If you can get the app to work, trust me, you‚Äôll be happy. The manual ‚Äòset it up from the console‚Äô only has left and right arrows with an OK button to advance the letter system. So typing in any kind of lengthy or difficult password will take a hot minute!Clicking the power button puts it in a kind of sleep mode and to power it off completely hold the power button down for about 5 seconds.Once the printer was fully configured, I did a power on time test. From completely turned off, a click of the power button to ‚Äòstatus ready‚Äô took 53 seconds in Wi-Fi mode. I tested when configured via network cable and exactly the same time.Next up: the PC install. I tried to find ‚Äòjust the driver‚Äô on the cd but the Lexmark installer is pretty much going to have to run on your local system (the web site had a more current version to download). I was thankful that at the end of the install process was a separate ‚Äòutility‚Äô installer for a system tray application to keep you aware of print job status, ink levels and other standard tray alerts. Thank you for not forcing it on us! But, it‚Äôs there if you like that sort of thing.The first thing I printed? My notes for this review! It was fast, I didn‚Äôt time it and only a few lines.The second thing was the image of the printer on the product page. I started the stop watch once I saw the communication light stop blinking, which is when you hear the printer spin up. Semi color page took 8 seconds.Two page document with both sides printing, 15 seconds. Same doc two pages: 10 seconds. 20 page single document B&W and Color both clocked in around 50 seconds. The attached vid shows the pace of a print jobs and the method of double-sided printing.Next I printed a color seating chart of Sun Trust field. Clicking print to finish was 15 seconds. 5 seconds communications and just under 10 seconds later it was in the tray.The printer comes with toner of course and the cartridges are going to yield approximately 500 pages for each of the Color cartridges and up to 750 pages for the Black print cartridge. Each cartridge has a model number for the ‚Äòreturn‚Äô version service and new version model numbers of standard yield and high yield. As of this posting, prices are not available on the site.Overall this was an easy to set up laser printer that is perfect for a small business or home office, could service a larger set of users easily and prints a quality sheet relatively fast. It‚Äôs got beefy stats and does what they said it would do."
