R308V8ELPTPG08,"July 30, 2020",James M. Mcguire,3,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Printer is working but it's a returned printer.,"While setting printer up I noticed a few things that were not right. The tabs that you are required to remove for each color and black printing were missing. Next, when I opened the paper tray, there was paper already in it. When I went through the setup, I found it had already been set up once before in May of this year (this is July). Clearly, I didn't get the NEW printer I had ordered. The WiFi setup was harder than any other printer I have used to date (I've set up 5 since WiFi was an option), but I finally got it working. Print quality is OK for B/W text but not dark and uniform when using large fonts. The user manual was missing but I downloaded it on a PDF. Oh yeah, there was no registration card for warranty purposes. We'll see how hard it will be to register it online.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R308V8ELPTPG08?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R3LQOVVEX25D52,"July 16, 2020",kmt22,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Not good,"I did not believe the one star reviews mixed 50/50 with five star reviews - I wish I had. I bought this to use with Android phones in my household. If this printer works well, it must only be for certain phone types. This review is for use with the LGV50 ThinQ and Samsung Note 8.- Documentation is inadequate or non-existent. It's enough to get cartridges installed and printer turned on. After that, virtually no online reference to this specific printer exists, whether it be detailed manuals, online forums discussing specific problems, mobile drivers, etc. The only ""support"" that is useful is this page of Amazon customer reviews.- Wireless setup is cumbersome but not impossible. I was able to connect to my home wifi and produce a Wi-Fi direct network using the front panel. Feels like texting did in the year 2003, tapping each character out. It's easy to set a static IP address if desired, but this made no improvement in my ability to connect.- Due to wireless connectivity issues, I purchased a USB-B to USB-C cable. That's right, this does not support multi use USB and requires the ancient square USB type which I specially ordered on Amazon. No USB cables were supplied with my printer.- The Lexmark app from the Google play store specifically does not support this model of printer. I was able to load my doc but in the end, no connection to the printer. That leaves third party apps only.- Printers could be set up and available in my printer apps, but when selected, the printer is always ""unavailable right now."" Even when the printer happened to recognize a connection which I accepted on its front panel, the app would return ""internal printer error."" It takes over an hour of cycling apps and connection types to finally get a connection. I have had intermediate success with Samsung Print Service (even on my LG phone) and NoKo Print (over USB only). I have never been able to print from Lexmark Print or Mopria (supposed to be the universal standard of mobile print drivers with a consortium of manufacturers).- Note that print is only possible for photos and pdfs. Do not expect to print a webpage or other content without making a pdf first, unless specifically supported by the app.- The buffer is small. It will print one page, pause, print the next, pause. This takes up a lot of time for multi page documents.- Print quality is as expected from a cheap laser printer. Relatively crisp depending on the document. Occasionally get a thin red stripe down one side of the page. Pictures are ok, not great.- The thing weighs 50 pounds. How can I return that?? Get a strong desk or stand.In the end, this printer will let you down. If you are unlucky enough that your device doesn't play nicely, there is no remedy. I spend around an hour fighting with the printer each time I need something, usually an important form or tax document. Sometimes I just give up. And it doesn't even have a scanner, so it has no redeeming qualities. Save your money and go to a brick and mortar store to purchase a printer that is known to work with mobile devices. They cost more because they WORK. I am sorry I bought this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LQOVVEX25D52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

The price was right and Lexmark does have a good reputation. While the quality of printing and copying is good the software interface is just awful. It's clear that the lexmark programmers are sloppy and just not in tune with reality. User instructions are poor, and even the online stuff is bad. The printer is constantly going into ""offline"" mode and there is no way to change that except to unplug the device. You can;t even power down and then up again to reset it. You actually have to disconnect the power cord. So dumb. The scanner/copier feeder is also poor in that it can only handle about 5 pages otherwise it gets jammed.Scanning is also another issue as you actually have to set up the email account on the printer to get it to work or use a USB stick. Also dumb.

R16KJZQTOTLVJC,"July 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,1,MC3326adwe,Verified Purchase,toner costs more than the printer,"I print a lot, and I knew that I would be changing out an ink cartridge every week at the rate I print. I wanted a color printer since I do print documents and articles with color prints and images. Instead of an inkjet I decided to buy this laser printer, anticipating it would be cheaper in the long run than inkjet. I was wrong. After the 2nd week of having it I ran out of black toner which the printer informed me was low. I ordered the toner ($90 by the way), you have to order it since it is not sold in stores, (tried staples, best buy, office max, walmart, target, costco, etc). After the toner arrived I installed it and tried to print but it would not print since now the color toners were out. It did not mention that. I thought ok, I will only print in black and white or grayscale until I can get the color toner replaced. NOPE it will not print if any toner is out. I look up the color toner to purchase and it cost $100 MORE than the printer cost!!! I should have looked at that before buying the printer but I did not expect it to be so expensive. It is now a VERY expensive paperweight, as I refuse to pay more for my toner than for my printer. I ended up buying an inkjet, and although I will probably spend more money in the long run, I live paycheck to paycheck, I can purchase a $30 ink cartridge here and there, I can not drop $350 all at one time for toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KJZQTOTLVJC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,3,0,No,

R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ,"July 20, 2020",So disappointed,5,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,Amended review,"I purchased this printer after a great deal of long research. I broke my beloved canon and had been wanting to buy a color laser for over a year, and I purchased it after reviews from Amazon. I was aware the toner would not last very long, the estimate ranged from 200-300 pages, but the yellow toner ran out after only a few pages, and the printer would not print except in black without two yellow streaks down the side of the page. Prior to that, the print quality was fantastic -- it was super easy to set up - my computer did all the work -- it is connected to my printer via a cord, so I'm not doing any wireless printing -- I'm old, and I print mainly from digitals stored in my computer, so wireless is not a necessity for me -- Even though the printer was advertised as ""new"" I was concerned it had been returned -- I contacted Amazon via chat, and the young man that resolved my issue could not have been more helpful -- I could not find any generic or after-market cartridges such as ones available for canon and HP. I finally found replacement Lexmark cartridges from a company called quill.com -- at the most reasonable price I could find -- it was still $80, but it's supposed to last for roughly 600 pages -- this is the recycling program, which I like -- you could buy a cartridge with longer life for about $20 more -- also, I watched videos on youtube about replacing the toner powder at home and then resetting the printer chip -- you can buy toner for about $13 -- that may be an avenue I experiment with -- but as far as ease of use and print quality, I love it very much -- I make journals and one of the downfalls is, if you get a drop of water on an inkjet image, the whole page is ruined because it will smear -- I've had mono laser printers since the 1990's, so I knew if you act quickly, it could be saved -- when the printer arrived, I did a lot of water tests, and was very pleased with the results. Now that I know I can find cartridges at a reasonable cost, I'm much happier -- if you purchase from this seller, contact them prior to shipping -- shipping was delayed, and I still wonder if this was a returned printer -- so get sales person's name and write down exactly what they tell you. I hope this helps with your research.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,0,No,
R1CLTKNQSPQYOF,"July 19, 2020",Donald V. Rutkowski Jr.,1,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,The scanner functional is not efficient.,"The printer was easy to setup and I was printing paper within minutes. Now the scanner part, is a whole different story. After spending about 4 to 5 hours trouble shooting the scanner issue, I finally figured out how to scan from the printer to the computer and its not efficient at all.First you have to download the ""Lexmark Scanback Utility"", which is not part of the original driver package. Once you install and start running the utility, you will create a scanner profile. Second, you have to go back to the printer, load the paper you want to scan, then select the scanner profile you created. Once that is all done, you have successfully scanned your document. The big issue about this is, you have to run this process each time you want to scan a document. Your scanner profile is not saved to printer. Each time, you have to start the profile, load the paper then select the profile. After spending all this time on this new printer, I actually figured out how to get my older printer working better than this one.I am looking to return this somehow.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CLTKNQSPQYOF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review.

R30TVCKU4YYDM2,"June 24, 2020",Kevin Harrington,2,MC3426adw,Verified Purchase,Right Out Of The Box,"Set up for this printer is relatively easy *if* you have some knowledge of networking via ethernet and/or WiFi. It's not too difficult. The printer arrived where the carton appeared to be in excellent condition. The unit is well padded, and plenty of security tape to keep doors, trays and lids in place during shipping. Getting the printer up and running was easy for both the Mac and PC systems. The catch with this printer is the paper tray. The tray isn't the best solution in the printer industry. Considering the printer is 50 lbs. in weight, I'd assume the paper tray would have been constructed with metal guides and a solid tray solution. Not the case, it is all plastic. The tray and the printer paper *pick up function* didn't work well right out of the box. Of several 10's of sheets of different paper, none of the paper used would be successfully drawn from the tray to be printed. The printer *pick up function* from the tray was inadequate, with only one sheet out of 20+ attempts to print with this printer.Paper used: HP Premium 20 lb. paper HP Premium 24 lb. paper HP Premium 32 lb. paper HP Mulitpurpose 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Paper 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Plus 20 lb. paperThe tray filled with each of the different paper types, filed at full capacity, half capacity, near empty capacity... the results were the same. Every type of paper would begin its journey as the *pick up mechanism* would extract about 2 inches of the top sheet, then slice two one inch tears into the edge of the paper. The printer would report the *tray out of paper.* Clearly there's something wrong with this printer, at least the one received. The remedy to clear the ""out of paper"" error was to remove the tray, remove the damaged top sheet, then install the tray, and do the same thing over, and over, and over again.The price for a scanner, printer, fax, copier machine is reasonable, but if it doesn't work, it's a waste of time.The other Lexmark printer owned for several months/years is the model C2535.

This compact color MFP can fit almost anywhere. (13. 6 x 16. 2 x 15. 5 inches / 344. 4 x 411. 2 x 394. 1 mm), according to its makers. It is also, according to its makers, easy to use: its makers claim that it is plug it in and ready to go. Furthermore, they add that its standard wi-fi makes it easy to print from mobile devices.That it is interconnective: its 2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information. That it will enable the user to scan to network, email, FTP, or USB stick drive, scan to, print files from popular cloud services with Lexmark's Cloud Connector, while providing security. That its extra high yield unison toner will provide up to 4, 500 pages of output, so the user can print more, stop less. And it is durable, as its steel frame, long-life imaging components mean it’s built to last. So the user can get solid performance, get things done with a 1-GHz dual-core processor, output up to 26 ppm. The manufacturers also state that the printer, with its Unison Toner, will deliver rich, vibrant color with crisp details, for outstanding quality. The manufacturers also claim that this printer will deliver media flexibility, enabling the user to get universal media handing from A6 to legal; support for specialty media like envelopes, optional input expandable up to 751 pages.

Then, setting it up is anything but easy: the makers offer a coupla pages of weird diagrams, no written instructions, and a CD. Whose computer has CD portals anymore? Then, it doesn’t print pictures, to those of you who might want to. And it needs lithium batteries which are difficult to fit, pricey. But my main problem with it was my difficulty in figuring out the scan function, which is not even listed on its index of available functions. ( And, by the way, its touch screen is tiny.) And figuring out how to scan was difficult even with the help of my professional computer guru. In my life, I must have the ability to scan, as, even though this printer, like my previous model, offers the ability to fax, the wiring in my place doesn’t allow this function. So I must scan and email important documents. Gotta scan.

R8Z4KZYQ63GSK,"May 26, 2020",S. Brown,2,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,no documentation and heavier than most printer stands can take,"I was excited to be offered to test and review this printer. Most of the places I’ve worked at have had Lexmark printers as they are such workhorses. But I haven’t personally owned one and so never had to try to set one up before.First thing you need to know is that this printer is HEAVY. It comes in at 50 pounds. And until I got this, I had no idea that almost all printer stands will only support a printer of 30 pounds. It took me awhile to find a stand that would be big enough (it also has a larger footprint than my previous printers) and sturdy enough and rated to handle the weight of this. After I found one and ordered it, I was contacted by the seller, in very broken English, asking me to please cancel the order because they really didn’t have any stands! After many more hours of searching, I gave up on printer stands and found instead a “roll cart with drawers” (no longer available) that was big enough and rated to hold the weight. After it finally arrived, I then had to assemble it and wait for the glue to dry before I could use it.So now the printer is on the stand and I am ready to set it up. Not. There are no directions or manual or any real info with this. All it came with are several pages of pictures showing you how to remove all the tape and packing material in, on and around the printer. The only other thing they show is putting the CD into your computer. I tried that. It did NOTHING. The CD does not have a manual or info or anything like that on it. Instead it appears to be a program that will auto install the drivers and optionally some utilities. However, you have to first have the printer on your wifi.There are NO directions or information on how to connect to your wifi. On all of my previous wifi printers, they came with detailed, step by step directions that were easy to follow. This printer leaves you to figure it out yourself. First issue is the password.The touch screen “buttons” you need to press to enter your password as so tiny that I found it impossible to know if I pressed the right one. This is due to the fact that the screen does not show you what you pressed! Not even momentarily. Nope, it gives you nothing but asterisk. Maybe if I had a short password, it would be ok, but ours is very long and a mix of letters and numbers. I tried repeatedly, but it would not work for me. After a few more days I found an old rubber tipped stylus and that helped. They next problem was with our router (I didn’t have anything to do with the purchase of this or it’s setup – it is NOT one I would have chose).I finally seemed to have gotten the right combination of “buttons” on the printer and the router pushed and with the stylus, the right characters for the password input and it connected to wifi. Running the CD was easy and I did install one of the optional programs.You would think all is fine finally and I would be able to use the printer. And you would be wrong. I thought I would start by scanning in some art that I recently finished. On almost every printer I’ve worked with before, there would be a “button” for “print”, “fax”, “copy”, and “scan”. Nothing so simple on this one. The only “scan” option says “scan profiles”. Since there are no instructions for anything, I push that. Big mistake evidently. The printer locked up. It was completely non-responsive.After 30 minutes, I gave up and pulled the plug. That seemed to reset it from the beginning when I first turned it on. It did however, remember the network and connect itself without my intervention. It takes several minutes to get itself ready. Now I no longer have the “scan properties” option.So this time I decided to try printing from the cloud. I signed into One Drive through Word and saved this document. Went to the printer and selected One Drive. It makes me give it a name for some weird reason then tells me I have to go to a website and read pages of legalese and agree then input a code. I did all of that and found myself at a sign in to One Drive. Weird. I just signed in. So I sign in here and see nothing for me to do and can not find the cloud storage from here. It just got me to my account info with Microsoft.I go back to the printer, figuring I did what it said so I was good to go. NOT. The printer is showing me the code again and telling me I have to go agree and input the code on the website. Round and round we go. I again hit ok. BTW, before you can type that URL in and connect, the printer will flip screens so you have to again click several times to get back to the code so you can type it in. I again agree, and again am set to sign in with Microsoft. This time, MS asks if I want to let my printer have access to my cloud. Amongst the things I expected, for some reason Lexmark also is saying it has to have full access to my profile. Not sure why it would need that to print but I don’t save much to the cloud so I don’t really need to be concerned – I hope.So, I grant access and end up back at Lexmark which now has a message that I am ALMOST done. That now that it is set up, I HAVE to print from the cloud within 72 hours or it will delete all of this info and I have to start all over again. Fine. Whatever. I select the cloud and the named profile and find my directory tree as in OneDrive. Choose something to print and not sure what to do next. I take a chance and press the arrow and it prints. So that at least seems to work as advertised after you jump through the hoops.Print quality was excellent and the photos and illustrations came out fantastic. There was no banding in the gradients and the colors were good. Very pleased with this part of the printer.I can’t find any options to scan except scan to cloud. That is extremely disappointing. I don’t see why there isn’t a scan to computer option like all my other printers have had. That makes an extra step for me. Scan to cloud, go to cloud to retrieve. Why? That is just dumb. I guess they figure you only use this for business and not for ever using with photos or graphics that need repair or retouch/rework in a program on your computer.So my low rating is mainly due to the lack of documentation. I have lots of options when I click on things but no idea what they mean or do. I don’t really have the time to sit and hit all the buttons to see what happens. I have things I need it to do and simply want to know how to do them. I shouldn’t have to first figure it out on my own.-------------It is now August 2020 and I have been online and found the documentation. While it is helpful, the printer still requires you to jump through a ton of hoops to do everything except a straight print from computer.I use my printers to scan in documents and this is NOT easy on this printer. It can be done but with many many unneeded steps in comparison to EVERY single printer I have ever owned.You have to open the scan utility. I had to download that software and install first. Then you have to pick what size document you want to scan. Fine. You would think that would be it. That the printer would be smart enough for you to select this ONCE and done. Then if you needed to make a change, you would go back and change it. NO doesn't work like that.You have to give it a profile name. That name is then sent to the printer under the very unintuitive menu item of ""shortcuts"". Then you click on shortcuts and then your name and then it will do it. However it will always use the same path name and same file name for every time. NOT useful.To make it work, I set up two different profile ""shortcuts"" (interesting that they don't both appear on the printer - only the one at a time). Then I make a desktop shortcut. One is for legal sized and one is for letter. It will not print any larger than letter, but it will scan larger.So I pick either the letter or the legal desktop shortcut I made. It gives me a dialog box on the computer that I MUST answer NO to in order for this to work. if I answer yes, the scans will always over write each other. only THEN can I go over to the printer, wake it up by pushing the arrow ""button"", wait until it gives me the screen and find ""shortcuts"" then the name of the ""profile"". I forget what it is called, but I think it is just scan. I can't get it confused because I only ever see the one associated with the desktop shortcut!Then I put the item on the glass and push the arrow button again and it scans.what a huge PITA. I have never had to jump through so many hoops to do almost everything with a printer. It insists that you create profiles and each one has to have a name before it will do anything. But every time I look, there are no profiles listed in the menu. Very odd. You have to jump through this naming garbage to use the cloud print or scan also.I guess you could say I love/hate this thing. It works well, just it is a royal pain to use.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8Z4KZYQ63GSK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,2,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review and we are sorry to hear about the challenges you faced with setting up this printer.

This Lexmark is a step up from the quality that I’m used to from them. The construction doesn’t feel as cheap or shoddy, and it actually feels like a fairly solid printer. I like that they’re upping the quality for home laser printing. I much prefer laser quality over ink, and they have not disappointed in that regard. The toner replacement seems a little steep, but if you’re getting 4500 pages as opposed to 500, it can average out.That being said, the touch screen is a little too small for my fingers, and makes it difficult to use. The setup is pretty straight forward and easy with no real surprises if you have any kind of familiarity with printer set up.

R2T03U91SZ94NP,"May 19, 2020",Jon R,1,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, hampered by terrible software","The short version: Don’t bother with this, while the hardware is good it’s paired with terrible software that ruins the experience. You can get much better for the same price, in fact it’s actually on the upper end of what I’d consider reasonable pricing. You can probably get the same or better for even less if you look for sales.Longer version:As I said the printer hardware is nice. It’s not too big for a color laser, prints clearly on every paper type, is fairly quiet, and fast. I’d give the hardware a 4/5 if Lexmark could hire someone who knew anything about software to fix the garbage software this thing runs.Now first let me side track a bit because this needs mentioning. The instructions that come with this are ridiculous. You get a about 7 pages of paper with no words, just photos (poor ones at that) and a CD. Honestly, who still has a CD drive on their computer? If they want to throw one in, fine, but they also need a thumb drive or just tell you where to go to download manuals and let you know to do it online. The good news is those do exist, but you have to go to Lexmark’s website and find it yourself. I work in IT, so I knew how to setup a printer, but not everyone does. Those pictures (I’m not even going to call them instructions) are not going to help anyone.Now with that out of the way back to my reason for rating this printer low despite the nice hardware. The crap software. So the first thing I ran into was the printer suggested using an app to set it up faster. That’s cool, other printer have done that and it can be easier then trying to set it up on those small screens. Except this app just doesn’t work. For one thing it’s about as bare bones as you can get, and looks like it hasn’t been updated in years (and the update notes suggest it hasn’t, they only added support for newer printers). It couldn’t find the printer, which is expect during setup but it gave no instruction on how to connect to the printer. I finally got it to see the printer by using my phone’s WiFi direct. Except the app, either due to poor design or a bug, did not do any setup it went right to the main screen, and once again complained about not finding the printer. I gave up on that and decided to do it on the printer itself. I don’t think even the most petite persons fingers could type on that keypad. It took several tries to get the passwords to match because you can't see what you are typing, so I kept making typos. Next up was WiFi. Connecting to the network took a few tries, again, because there are not clear instructions included nor onscreen instructions. Once I was connected, it worked but again I am in IT and know about these things. Someone not in IT probably would have a harder time. Now begins another annoying adventure - I get through the needlessly annoying setup and arrive at the main screen. Several things have a lock beside them so I try to enter my password from earlier to unlock them, and it doesn’t work. I guess I might have typed it wrong since the keypad is so hard to use. So I go into settings and find the option to do a factory reset, nothing happens when I tap it. After some frustration I realize you have to restart the printer for the reset to happen – why wouldn’t it tell me that? Ok annoying setup again, this time I say screw the password and just make it 12345, it’s not like anyone else has access to this. Ok good news is that the password works now. Now the thing has the wrong region? What? It doesn’t let me change it either. I tried ANOTHER reset and during setup the region was STILL locked to the wrong location. After much frustration I found it can be changed via the web interface. FINALLY the printer is ready to use.First thing I try is via my phone since I have it with me. I try their app, because the app for my HP printer had been handy. Lexmark’s app is as useless as that setup app, bare bones, and outdated. I just decided to use Android’s printing and that worked. Next up my iPad. Since this is an Airport printer I decided to use that. Well, Airport was a no-go, it could never connect. I tried their iOS app and it was no better then their Android one. So basically it’s a no-go for iOS printing. And final my Windows PC. Their Windows software is trash like the rest. Windows couldn’t find the printer without Lexmark’s crap software. But I used the old manual printer setup to manually enter the IP and it was able to connect and print.See the pattern here? Lexmark should hire some high school kid to go and recode all their software, because it’s obvious nobody there knows how to do it. When you factor in the headaches this terrible software will give you, this printer is not worth the price.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T03U91SZ94NP?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,1,2,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review.

RGQVHD00RV4Y1,"July 15, 2020",Nathan,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,rapid print and high resolution,"We have been VERY pleased with this printer for our home office. Install only took minutes with finding an appropriate place for it (printer is hefty and a large size) and plugging it into power. Connection to our desktop took just a few minutes and that was able to be completed wirelessly. My wife and I also have the app connected to our phones so printing from mobile devices is easy as a few clicks. We have been through about a ream (500 pages) of paper or so and no jams. Granted we have only been using the tray and not the manual feed. Printing speed is mind-blowing, actually takes longer for the printer to process the print job and spool up than for the paper to come out. What is also very impressing is the picture printing quality when using photo paper. Overall, a great home office printer if you need something heavy duty and not have to worry about the ink drying out from time between uses like a standard inkjet.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGQVHD00RV4Y1?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,0,0,No,

R2LG9CZCCKIY1W,"June 21, 2020",Matt P.,4,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Excellent, Fast Printing In A Heavy Plastic Housing","Lexmark is known to make some excellent printers, both large and small, for business and home use. This model could be used easily for a home office, and for a small business that needs high quality prints. Set up on this is easy and straightforward, and can be used with WiFi or Ethernet. App is available for WiFi set up. i was very disappointed in the touch screen, where all your settings and options are found. This Lexmark sells for $259.00 (as of this review), and for that money, if it's gonna have a touch screen, it should be at least big enough to see the text, and definitely big enough for your fingers to be able to use it. The description states ""2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information"". I hardly believe it to be ""convenient interaction"" at all, when I had to enter my password for WiFi, literally, I had to do it like 5 times. I know my password, but the keyboard is so small, even my smaller fingers had a tough time landing on the touch key correctly, and hitting the right letter or number. There's plenty of real estate on here that another inch would not have interfered with anything, and made a world of difference. The price of screens like this has pretty much dropped to rock bottom, they are so widely produced, so don't understand. I have a $69 Canon that has a touch screen at least 50% bigger, and much easier to use than this.As others have stated, the paper tray is a little flimsy, not falling apart flimsy, but not as exact as I thought it would be. The entire housing looks like it's made of plastic (it states it has a metal frame), and although that in itself is not bad, it's just some parts, like the tray, could have used a little more support, and sliding in and out, it could have used a sturdier slide than what it has. If I had bought a printer for under $100 bucks (which there are more than enough of those to choose from, and getting better quality every day), this is what I would expect. As far as the main feature, and what this is built for, printing, it's excellent. Prints are sharp, even the smallest print. Pictures are color perfect, even at 8x11, they look great. All print out quickly, and to me, quietly. I know some have stated this is a loud printer. The only times I notice it is loud was the initial setup, and if it's been totally shut down. I leave mine on standby, and pretty much just makes a kind of fan running sound when it's printing, quiet to me, and then goes back to sleep until I wake it again. FYI: This is a printer only. I think a lot of people (like my wife too, was wondering where you lift up to scan and make a copy, it doesn't, this is a one trick pony, but it's excellent at it. If you are looking for a high quality printer function only, for professional looking work, this can do the job. It's also expandable to a second tray if you need to do a lot of printing. Toner is not cheap, depending on where you shop I guess. Average price I found, for the black cartridge only, was about $100 bucks, at a very well known national office supply company. But, printer toner is known to vary wildly in price, and tomorrow it could be $19.99, who knows. Overall, an excellent printer, in a good looking, VERY heavy, plastic housing. If you don't care about anything else about this printer, except that you want perfect, professional looking print, at a reasonably priced small office printer, this is your man (printer). Lexmark makes great printers, this is one of them, and my only major gripe was the screen, and the paper tray a minor gripe. Other than that, even my other printer I had for a few years because it always performed so well (from a very well known company that also makes good printers, and sold for around the same price as this), didn't print as well as this when it came to precision print. For the price, I'm impressed with the print, and worth the asking price (especially if they decide to do something with that screen!)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LG9CZCCKIY1W?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,

This wasn’t the case with this wireless laser printer. First, let me say that I actually much prefer toner over ink cartridge printer. I think the quality is much better. In that, the Lexmark didn’t disappoint. The quality of the color printing was crisp and clean, just as I would hope for.It was an easy set up process, and I was able to get it going in very short time. It is on the heavy side, but when you stop to consider that it has 4 separate cartridges, one for each of the CMYK, that can be expected. It is also loud when winding up and printing, although it sits quietly once it is all settled until, until you print. Again, not unexpected for laser printer.It does print pretty quickly, which is a bonus, but I feel that it is not all together as sturdily made as I would like. I feel sometimes that I have to be extra careful not to break some of the flimsier pieces, which sadly are ones that would have to be moved more often for replacing toner, etc.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38NG82GBK4NTD?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,
R24L4T9DX86HG4,"May 14, 2020",Billz,3,C3426dw,Vine Customer,Great quality with difficult Mac WiFi connection,"The quality of the printed documents in color is superb ... even on inexpensive printer paper (see picture). Once connected, the Lexmark C3426dw Color Laser Printer is easy to use, adjust and do everything I want with a printer. However, in attempting to make a wireless connection, I was stymied at every turn. I use a Macintosh computer — an iMac with a MacOS 10.15.4 Catalina operating system. It's the latest, but it's not a brand new OS—been around for a year...maybe a little less. When I began setting up the printer for a wireless connection, I followed the steps, but at some point in the process, I was told that I needed new firmware to continue. I downloaded the Lexmark Virtual Solution Center Plugin to update the firmware and went to open the .dmg file with the app, and was told by my computer that it could not be opened because ""Apple cannot check it for malicious software"" and directed me to contact the app-maker. At that point I was ready to give up, but I had a cable that I could physically connect to my iMac via the USB port to a port on the Lexmark. I did so, and presto! Everything worked fine; except for the fact that I cannot use it with WiFi. In the past, my wife and I shared a printer using WiFi, but not with this new Lexmark even though past Lexmarks we've owned worked fine with WiFi connections. Lest one groan ... ""...it's a Mac..."" consider that the computers filling art and graphic departments are likely to be Macs—that's where a color printer is most likely to be used.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24L4T9DX86HG4?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for taking time to write a review.

RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",V-TEAM,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,3,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively. Just be prepared to work though some issues with the initial setup.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EARTFHZLR1C9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,

I chose to connect via cord, but you have wireless options present.Printing speed, for me, hits 41 PPM. When I do speed print with this, every page is consistent in quality.

As I mentioned above, Lexmark makes great stuff and this printer is no different.In sum, this is a great option for the home or small business.

They aren't sold on amazon that I could find (or anywhere else for that matter). I think I ordered the correct thing on the Lexmark website, but it cost me over $120. I personally can't afford a replacement cartridge every month at that price.

RH9GU757CDJQ9,"June 28, 2020",Jimster480,4,B3340dw,Vine Customer,A fast printer with an easy setup but a weird amount of network usage,"I setup this printer to replace my 6 year old $50 laser that has been chugging along faithfully. I've tested out a few other printers in the last months but this one is my favorite so far.The Good:- Has double sided printing (has to be a 2 page + document though)- Very fast printing (wake up to print time is around 14 seconds, only around 4 seconds if its on ""sleep"") and definitely hits its 40ppm claim. I did print out over 20 sheets for my son (single sided) in one clip and it was done in under 1 minute (including warm up time from ""sleep).- The printer Has Ethernet and a screen where everything can be setup without a PC even if it takes a little while on the 2 line screen. I was able to plug it into my network and get it working via the printer only in about 5 minutes.- Print Quality is very good; much better than my old $50 laser which is impressive considering how fast it spits the pages out!- Large Paper Tray; Holds 250 sheets and actually has a meter that tells you how much paper there is (in 3 different tiers of full, Nearly Full, OK) in the printer. Paper tray can be adjusted to various different types of paper so cards and other smaller formats can be printed.- Has a 50 sheet bypass tray in the back for separate paper types.- Drivers make it easy to setup duplexing and paper sizes.- Allows for PIN based print and hold features for offices; so users can print confidential documents that they will need to enter a pin to physically print out (printer will hold the print job in memory until it is retrieved).- Supports PCL5e; great for workgroups and other network printing scenarios.- Supports Wifi-Direct; this allows for direct printing from laptops or mobile devices without needing to be on the local network. You can enable to disable this in the options menu.- Supports Google Cloud Print: It can be toggled with a single button in the operator menu.- Super easy website user interface; Every area has easy drop down options and even firmware can be easily updated with a couple clicks via this page (printer local IP address). Check the included image to see what the page looks like.- Supports 500+ page paper trays or multiple paper trays. There is a whole family of printers from Lexmark that share paper trays; giving you many options to expand your paper capacity if need be.Cons- Has a coil whine that repeats 2x/second when its on ""sleep"" mode; must put printer into hibernate (which takes between 30-40 seconds to wake up) to make this go away.- Default windows driver install on a ""detected"" printer only contains the MAC address and not the name of the printer. Also has weird printing limitations and doesn't work properly. Drivers from the website are required to fix this.- 2 Line screen has poor viewing angles requiring you to be over the top of the printer to view it.- Rear Bypass tray requires Printer to not be near a wall. You need a full foot + behind the printer to be able to use it. Making it pretty useless in most applications since the power, ethernet, USB connections are around the bypass tray.- Uses a bunch of data on the network; I logged over 300MB in a day of data transfer without any printing. This seems to happen even when its on hibernate. My other printers use less than 1MB a day of data. I am not sure why this printer keeps sending 200kb every minute or so.Conclusion:I think I will be keeping this one to use it for my kids. Toner prices are decent with 3000 page toner cartridges available for under $90 (at the time of writing) and 1500 page ones available under $60.Considering the price of toner for some other printers on the market; this is both affordable and competitive.Overall this is a great printer for the money; it is very fast, prints with great quality and has a smaller form factor. Unlike other printers I have tested; this one I can actually recommend. It seems to also go on sale pretty frequently; meaning that you might be able to pick it up at an even better deal than the regular price.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful!

R2D8D7FIKARD1S,"August 7, 2019",optimummind,4,C3224dw,Vine Customer,Good-value color laser printer with inconsistent wake-up printing time.,"=== My Take ===The Lexmark C3224dw is my first ever color laser printer and I like it very much for the most part. I like its compact and space-saving design and dimensions despite its heavier than expected heft. The control panel screen is bright & clear and the buttons around it are very responsive to my inputs. It is very intuitive to operate even without consulting the user manual first.I also liked its print quality - both in color and black & white. Text and images came out clear and smudge-free and the printing speed was satisfactory. Print operations were quiet, even the warm-up routine. Intermittently, however, the printer took an unusually long time to wake up from its Sleep & Hibernate status. There were times when we waited for longer than 30 seconds before the printer began flashing its light & started to print. Once it got warmed up, though, all later printer jobs printed at normal and satisfactory speeds.Another strong point for the C3224dw is its fast and simple setup process. I added it to my home network using just the control panel buttons to select my home WiFi and typing in the password. This process was seamless and very smooth. I also connected the printer to my desktop via a USB Type B cable (not included in the box) and installed the printer by installing the driver package from the Lexmark website. You also have the option to set it up using an Ethernet cable (also not included).Despite easily adding the printer to my home WiFi, however, none of my Windows 10 laptops around the house could find the printer during an actual print job, such as from Microsoft Word and Chrome browser. My wifey, who is not very techy, got frustrated because the printer wasn't listed in the printer selection drop-down menu. I had to go to Settings in Windows 10 and add the printer manually by typing in its IP address on each of my laptops. Compared to my other printers from Brother and HP, this part of my printing experience was subpar and disappointing. I expected a big printer company such as Lexmark to do a better job integrating the C3224dw to Windows 10.Another surprising thing was that there was no Windows 10 Lexmark app for the C3224dw printer. In order to access its settings, I had to launch the Embedded Web Server by opening a browser such as Chrome and then typing in its IP address. I guess some people might prefer this approach because it is one less app you have to install but I wouldn't have minded a Windows 10 app. You can install the Lexmark phone app but I chose not to do so because I have too many apps installed already on my Galaxy S10+ (>200).Once you access the printer settings via the Embedded Web Server, things are pretty straightforward and easy to navigate within. There are two main settings categories - Status & Settings. Under Status, you can view any Alerts & Warnings messages, Supply/Toner status, and printer info (firmware version, paper bin status).Under Settings, there are six additional sub-categories: Device, Print, Paper, Network/Ports, Security, and Reports.Under the Device section, I found the following options to be useful for our home - setting up low printer supply email notifications, configuring Sleep & Hibernate timeouts, turning on Eco Mode, and performing a firmware update.Inside the Print section, I turned on Duplex printing & the Collate option and set image printing to ""Auto Fit.""Inside the Network/Ports section, I left alone all the numerous options at their default (Wireless, AirPrint, Ethernet, TCP/IP, SNMP, IPSec, 802.1x, LPD, HTTP/FTP, USB, Restrict external network access, WiFi Direct) but did activate Google Cloud Print.I also left everything at default in the Security sub-section.Although the Settings page is plain and simple-looking, navigation among the options was quick, responsive, and very satisfactory and I appreciated all options given to me.All in all, I'm happy & satisfied with the Lexmark C3224dw and I don't regret getting it. Hopefully future firmware updates will improve printer wakeup time from its Sleep/Hibernate status._____*Pros:-Easy setup (WiFi or USB Type B).-Control panel buttons are responsive and intuitive to use.-Both color and black & white prints come out nice and clear.-Compact footprint.-Quiet operation.-Supports Lexmark Mobile Print, Google Cloud Print, Mopria Print, Apple AirPrint, and Wifi Direct.-Settings page offer numerous fine-tuning, network, and security options._____*Neutral:-Pretty heavy~!!-Wake-up time from Sleep is longer than I prefer.-Printer didn't get auto-detected by Windows 10 on all of my laptops on my home network. I had to add it manually by entering its IP address.-Performing a firmware update over the Embedded Web Server isn't as easy & simple as doing it with a Windows 10 or smartphone app.-Cartridge replacements will cost around $300 for all four._____*Cons:-Once in a while, print jobs over WiFi took TOO long.

So far so good...","I am using this to replace a Brother laser printer (NO COLOR, NO WIFI) that I have used for 6 years and it was still going strong.So far I don’t regret the upgrade to this Lexmark. While it’s no faster to print than the Brother, it isn’t slower, and is MUCH quieter, which I like in my office setting. Print quality on the whole is excellent. As far as the color printing goes (which I don’t do much of), it looks good, but not great. You won’t confuse it for a photo printer, nor is it intended to be. For color documents, it’s MINT!What I don’t like...well, set up was sort of annoying. The machine prompts you to download the app on your phone, which I did. No matter what I couldn’t get the thing to connect. So I wound up backing out of the set up and doing it manually from the printer. Took forever punching in my cryptic WiFi password with no keyboard. After that, I did get a strange error about the Cyan cartridge. I cleared it and it hasn’t come back, so we will see.Overall it’s well made, has a good “heft” to it. It occupies only about the same space as my old B&W printer, which is impressive. Servicing and toner replacement is easy.

R31BL20KZA0QSQ,"July 29, 2019",Ugh,5,C3224dw,Vine Customer,A little clunky setup at first but great quality prints,"Printers can be hit-and-miss when it comes to setting them up and this one is no different. Upon powering up, the screen prompts you to approve several settings before eventually reaching a point where you'll continue via Lexmark's mobile app, or, continue with setting up on the printer directly. I opted to go to mobile app route since I'd be connecting to my wi-fi network and entering a password on the printer's minimalist screen would be a pain.On the mobile app, you'll be prompted to connect to a wi-fi signal being output by the printer, and from there you'll tell it what wi-fi network you want IT to connect to, along with the password, and you're set!...or rather...you should be. For me, everything appeared to be setup just fine, but for some reason, I still had to manually select a network and enter the password on the printer itself. Not really sure what went wrong, but that was a little annoying. Once connected, simply install the printer's driver software from the included disc (or download from Lexmark site) and you should be set.Besides that minor inconvenience, printing quality is perfect, and fast. It goes to sleep automatically after a period of not being used, and it doesn't make any noise or mechanical adjustments when being turned on/off, or when sleeping, or being woken. Other printers I've had all seem to make noise when doing this and this sometimes occurred in the middle of the night too, so it'd be a bit startling, but this Lexmark is perfectly quiet in this respect.Overall, really nice printer that does its job well.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BL20KZA0QSQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,3,0,No,
RYLHERBWWYBU8,"July 28, 2019",MWCraft,5,C3224dw,Vine Customer,Excellent Output; Easy Local or WIFI Setup,"Below are my thoughts/observations on the Lexmark C3224dw Color Laser Printer. Some pictures are also included.Setup- the printer box had illustrations on top showing how to remove the printer from the box. I found that helpful and accurate in how best to begin the setup process.- Inside, a two sided sheet showed additional instructions for removing the tape, setting up the toner cartridges (which were already installed) and adding paper- It came with an installation CD for use in setting the printer up as locally attached to a PC. - You will need to supply your own USB printer cord and connect it to the printer and PC. - Turn on the printer; load the CD in your computer’s drive and the install process will begin automatically (I installed it on a Windows 10 desktop). In a couple of minutes, my PC sent a pop-up message that it was done.- While the CD was installing the printer drivers, etc. to my PC, the printer itself also displayed messages on its display screen: - First, it asked if I wanted to setup the phone app. I declined this since I did not want another phone app. - Next, it walked me through the steps to set it up on my home WIFI. This was pretty easy to do but unavoidably repetitive. I.e., if your WIFI name is “KatManDu-74”, you will have to enter each upper/lowercase letter, character or number by repeatedly pressing an arrow key for each one then hitting “OK”. Not difficult to do but boring. This, of course, took longer to complete than the automated process with the CD.Output QualtiyIt is excellent. I printed multiple photographs and they looked great and also printed some test prints and plain text documents that also looked really good.Printing Through WIFIWithout installing any apps to my iPhone or iPad, I was able to print multiple photos even though the WIF router was upstairs and I was in the basement sitting next to the printer. This means the image was transmitted through the floor/walls to the router and back through the floor/walls to the printer without issue.Overall ImpressionsAs stated earlier, I did not install or test any Lexmark printing apps (for the phone or PC) but do not think they are needed for wireless/remote printing. They may have other features (low toner warnings, etc.) that you may desire so, that is a choice you must make..It is quiet, and gives excellent quality output whether locally attached to your PC or sitting as a standalone device on your WIFI. You also have the option of connecting it to your network using an Ethernet cable but I did not test that since making the WIFI connection was so simple.I am very happy with the Lexmark C224DW printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYLHERBWWYBU8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,21,0,No,

They are not extremely heavy printers but tend to also need to do some occasional scanning, were interested in the idea of being able to fax medical paperwork when they can't upload in an app, and liked the idea of not having to replace ink continually. So we're in business with this printer.Hardware: Very well constructed, more durably made than your average HP or Canon these days.Packing: Very well packed in materials that did not get damaged nor have issues during shipping.Unpacking: Very easy to slide out of the box, no acrobatics requiredSetup: Setup is very easy. I used the menu rather than an app or installing things on a computerAfter setup and installing the local drivers and configuring them, the printer is very responsive for printing even though its allowed to sleep most of the time. It also works well with AirPrint which is fantastic!The LCD screen is bright, color, and easy to use. The touch buttons are also very easy to use. The functionality of the scanner, toner loading, other physical functions are easy. Double side printing is very easy.This was almost a 5 star review but there were a couple software issues that got in the way and I'm sure will be resolved with software updates.1. When setting up the fax, no matter how many times I named the fax, it wouldn't save. I had to skip it and do it later by navigating the menu.2. The printer for some reason came thinking it's main paper tray was ""colored paper"" which caused every single computer I set up to cause the printer to throw an error every time they tried to print to ""plain paper"" which is the default for every printer in the world forever and always for it's main paper tray-- I'd guess this was a setup bug/error.3. I cannot for the life of me get the software and driver for Windows 10 to recognize this model of printer to display a scanning utility. I'm expecting this to be solved by a software update as well. I know this printer was listed as ""just announced"" on the web site. The driver installs fine, I can print fine, but when I open the utility for scanning it says no compatible models found. Even Windows 10 recognizes the scanning device but...So summary: The printer is fantastic, I love it, I wouldn't hesitate on buying but only if scanning over the network is absolutely essential, and I'd guess that should be solved soon.

R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,4,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,53,1,No,

RGN6CJJRKWO81,"August 6, 2019",Matthew R,5,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,Color printer/photocopier.  600dpi with photo enhancement.  Wireless capable and fast.,"This is a nice compact color printer. It also allows you to scan, fax and copy. The printer can copy/scan/print in 600dpi but if you use the photo settings you can get results that look better than 600dpi. It will not produce the results you would expect from a photo printer but it can produce nice quality output if you use the right settings.The touch screen is also in color and is bright and clear. (you can see it at an angle easily as well) It is nice to scroll through the menus like you would on your smartphone. (touch and drag)The scanner seems to make images a little brighter and a more 'washed out' than the original in some cases. The software comes with a TWAIN-compliant driver that will let you import images into your favorite graphics manipulation program. (like Photoshop for example) I was able to scan photos with close to photo-quality output by selecting the Photo Mode from the menu of the TWIAN driver and changing the dpi setting to 600. The image looked better than 600dpi but it did scan in 600dpi. The full 8.5x11 sheet was 5100 x 6600 pixels. (if you divide the pixels by 600 it ends up being 8.5 x 11)For office or home use, it is a great little printer as long as you aren't expecting it to print photo quality. One nice thing about a laser printer is that it can sit of years without issues, unlike an inkjet where the ink can dry and cause issues if it is not used frequently.The printer was easy to install and comes with an actual CD/DVD. (you can find the driver on Epson's website very easily if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer) It can also be set up to print from a phone over WiFi. My experience with printing from a phone is that it is a last resort since the phone itself limits the control you have over the print output.In summary, the printer only prints in 600dpi but some kind of enhancement is going on that makes photos look better than 600dpi when it is used. Even with those settings, it does not with photo quality results. For graphics, text and even photo-like quality, it is a great all-around multifunction.The printer goes to sleep on its own after a bit so to use it wirelessly you may need to power it on. It can be used as a scanner though it can only scan at 600dpi. (photo mode enhances the image for photos) I haven't tried the fax functionality since I do not fax much. The copier functionality is slick. You can navigate through the menus to get the optimal settings.It does everything I would expect it to do. The photo enhancements from photo mode produced very nice results for 600dpi, even though the output is not photo quality.

This Lexmark has so far fit the bill well with it compact size, quiet operation, and fast printing capability. There are many features packed into this printer, all of which is controlled on the almost over-sensitive touch screen (perhaps my fingers are just too big). Setup was fairly straightforward for me and I didn't need any assistance. Wired and wireless connections work very well and I have had zero problems with wireless connections.Print quality is excellent for text, and so-so for images. However, if you are looking to print quality images, that is where an inkjet will still be handy. For that reason, my old inkjet will stick around strictly for printing images.Lexmark also offers an exchange program for their toner cartridges, saving the consumer about 25%. You purchase a toner cartridge from Lexmark, in exchange for your old one. However, it appears that of the time of this review, it is currently unavailable.Overall, for a home, or even office, this is an excellent printer. Even if you don't print often at all, but need the printer to work at the snap of your fingers, I would suggest this laser printer over an inkjet because unlike ink, toner won't dry out and become waste.

After contacting Lexmark and sending examples and details (SN, proof of purchase etc) of the printer, the initial diagnosis was a faulty toner cartridge. A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience. Its possible that if you happen to get a working printer, it might serve you well. But don't count on much in the way of support from Lexmark if you happen to get a dud.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY11929L02OAT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,40,3,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  We are very sorry for your recent experience and, in this case, applaud you for your patience and commitment in trying to fix your Lexmark purchase.

If you copy or print anything that's more like diagrams or line art, the colors are great. Set up was smooth -- not quite as easy at the HP, but nothing to complain about. Print time and sound are similar to the HP. The HP is a little quieter.

R2S19CBIJT7PAR,"September 6, 2019",S,5,MC3224adwe,Vine Customer,"Solid, well-made printer","I got this Lexmark after my last printer died on me, and I’m pretty glad I did. It’s really well made, offers a ton of great features, and looks pretty good on my desk. While my needs for this printer aren’t many (I have another printer for my home office), it’s worked really well for me so far and I’d be happy to recommend it.Pros:When printing the black text shows up crisp and clear on the page, proving immediately that it’s a quality piece of equipment. It’s bold and punchy, and I haven’t had any trouble reading anything I’ve printed yet. The color printing for photos and images is pretty good, though I’ve seen much better from other printers. It’ll work just fine as long as printing color isn’t your main objective. After setup, the printer easily connects to my devices (Macbook, Android) without fail, and I’ve absolutely never had a problem.I love that the printer is so quiet - it doesn’t even wake my sleeping pets when they’re in the same room! The scanning feature is pretty easy to use and self explanatory with a regular speed. The small touchscreen is easy to use and lends a modern feel to the machine. Everything on the machine is high quality, and it feels like it’s made to last. Nothing flimsy whatsoever.Cons:As mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t recommend this printer if photos and color-use are your main objectives. While the printer works fine for these things, the vibrance is notably less than for my previous printer (Epson Workforce Pro WF-4630). This feels nitpicky, but I’d really have expected a larger paper tray from a printer of this size and price.Setup took a little longer than I’d prefer - you have to install a driver and painstakingly connect the printer to all your devices. Again, once setup, you’re good to go, but know that you’ll be sitting down for a good half hour or so to get it all working. For home use, I find the printer size a bit much. It appears to me a little smaller in the photos, so I was surprised when it arrived and I had to find a bigger spot for it.Overall, though, it’s a pretty good product. I’d happy suggest it.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S19CBIJT7PAR?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,1,0,No,

Well, I have used this printer in my office and was blown by the quality of prints it does. One day when I saw a huge discount on 3224awde I just make a purchase blindly and I am glad that I have invested in right thing. Here are some of the pros & cons about this printer.Pros:1. Print quality is best in this class of printer. I have compared it with HP 479fdw and color prints from hp doesn’t even come close to quality of lexmark.2. Color touchscreen provides great advantage of more controlled printing experience.3. Network connectivity and ease of access from ios or android device comes handy during the times when you are on phone and want to print something immediately without starting your laptop.4. It works great with mac.Cons:1. It is super heavy. If you are not taking proper precautions while moving it from one place to another you might break your back or damage printer badly.2. It performs poor with windows and thats why it has been notorious when it comes to reviews. I had to cancel my print jobs many times on windows but small tweaks or a restart resolves the issue.Final thoughts:If you are windows lover and love ease of access you might probably hate some of the complex troubleshooting other Operating Systems involved. Then this is not for you.If you are a techie person and love complex engineering and powerful experience then this printer is for you.Well I had mixed feelings but it hasn’t disappointed me so far.

R3KRCKVVDNC27R,"April 28, 2020",M. Gondek,3,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Tiny screen, loud, overpriced","This is my least favorite of several printers I've reviewed in the past couple of years. First, the good:1. Print quality is crisp, as you'd expect from a laser printer.2. Printing is fast. I don't feel like I'm hanging around, waiting for the printer to do its thing. That's after it's downloaded the data from WiFi, of course, which varies a lot by content.3. Small footprint. It really is a small machine, although it's deeper than an average bookshelf. It'll hang off the front or back, unlike other machines I've used that are wider (than deep).4. Reasonable setup. I installed from the DVD, although I suspect that wasn't necessary. It did install a very annoying pop-up ""information"" screen that also started appearing when I use my other Lexmark. I ended up uninstalling this, since it was useless and annoying.5. No problems with WiFi. It was set up and ready to go in a couple of minutes, and hasn't dropped or had any issues.Now the not-so-good:1. LOUD. When is was initializing, I thought it was about to take off for the moon, but it quieted down a little after that. Now it's just loud when... printing. It's easily the loudest printer I've used, so it's not a good choice if you're using it while on calls or otherwise don't want to listen to it all day.2. Tiny touchscreen. I have pretty small fingers (ladies size medium), and I had a heck of a time adding the WiFi password (for example). It's incredibly easy to fat-finger virtually everything, so using the screen is an exercise in patience and repetition (try again... try again...) That said, the touchscreen responds well.3. Flimsy build quality. The print drawer doesn't insert smoothly, and doesn't feel durable at all. All the hinges open/close slightly skewed, and take more effort than they should (and make me worry I'm going to break this thing). While flimsy printer drawers seem to be a Lexmark thing, I'd hoped they would improve on this for the new models. Nope.4. Way overpriced. The older MC series offers multi-functions at a cheaper price than this model. Since the touchscreen and print functions are the same on that series, I'm really not sure how the price of this single-function model is justified. It's just a printer. For a similar footprint and print experience, the MC series is a far better value.Recommended for: Someone who values a small footprint, doesn't mind the noise, and doesn't care about copying, faxing, or scanning, nor wants more than 1 print drawer. AND who doesn't mind paying more for this than a machine from the same company that has multi-functions in a similar footprint.Not recommended for: Everyone else",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KRCKVVDNC27R?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,6,0,No,
R249O2CUS9H2PY,"April 23, 2020",Dad5,1,C3426dw,Vine Customer,This one just wouldn't work...,"The Lexmark C3426 is an attractive, reasonably compact color laser printer that at least in this one case – just wouldn't work. The physical setup of the machine was simple with one sheet of illustrated instructions that was easy to follow (although the printer’s control panel keys are very small and difficult to use). The printer software was also simple to install and upon completion I was rewarded with a printer test page indicating the printer was “correctly installed”.And then the “fun” began. Despite a confirmed connection between computer and printer, a number of trial printing jobs resulted in “communication failure” error messages. The brief version: a one-page Word file printed just fine; a one-page Excel file had long delays for a queue issue and then either failed to print or printed one-half of the page and a one-page slideshow image failed to print at all. Not being a techie, I tried some of the standard fixes for a couple of hours, but nothing worked.Finally, I reached out to Lexmark technical support. The good news is that I was connected immediately. However, after two hours on the phone with the technician – during which I provided them with remote control of my computer; I moved the printer from the other room so it could be hooked up via ethernet directly to the router; and I watched patiently as they seemed to repeat clicks/commands that had already failed to work. Finally, I addressed the technician and asked what the prospects were for a resolution since we had been on the phone for two hours. I was told I probably had a wi-fi problem (despite the fact that the printer was located literally next to an Epson Workforce, with which we have no wi-fi issues) and that they were still trying to fix it. I also reminded the technician that (per the printer control panel) the printer was receiving the documents – it just wasn’t printing them.So, at that point I called a halt to the process and resolved to just return the printer to the box it came in.

R2HC9QGKLOCLA9,"April 20, 2020",Robert D. Harmon,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"sturdy, functional, good quality print","This printer was fairly easy to install and configure. The few sheets of instructions (pictograph) were a little puzzling but mainly involved steps in unpacking and untaping the unit (the outside tapes had a little folded-over bit at the end that made it easy to pull off -- no digging your thumbnail in). The installation CD is helpful but you can also download the manual from the Lexmark website, which appears to be good about product support, and the touch screen on the unit is easy to use, esp. regarding the Wifi connection. You will need to download the Lexmark printer driver, although the generic Windows driver worked well enough. The printer itself, so far, has proven fast, with fine print quality and good functionality, both for single-side printing and 2-side (duplex).Also, I've noticed no noticeable inrush, that is, the sudden electrical demand that a lot of laser printers make on startup and printing. I've had to exile some older laser printers to the other side of the house after they knock other devices off the circuit -- but not this one.Some minor quibbles: this is a straightforward color printer, with no scan or other functions. It can handle a fair range of paper sizes and weights, but is not a photo-quality printer. Unpacking the unit can be a problem, the unit is big and heavy enough, and in an outer Amazon box can be difficult to carry any distance; however, if you take the product box out you'll find handle-openings in that box, and easier to carry. You'll need a sturdy table or desk to hold the unit, and allow space not just for its footprint but a few inches around it for cooling.

R3OORQH2V2YHPH,"April 19, 2020",Blayne,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,Set up and printing wirelessly in under 10 minutes,"Review of: **Lexmark C3426dw Color Laser Printer**I literally unpacked this printer, set it up on its box on the floor, and was printing wirelessly from a laptop in under 10 minutes. No joke. All it required was to unpack the printer, follow the printed unpacking instructions to remove the tape and plastic protective tabs (I recommend using the printed instructions here because there were a set of shipping ""tabs"" in the print toner compartment that I would have missed), adding paper, and then following the manual on-screen setup prompts to get it online.I did use the WPS wifi config on my router to set this up. This is basically a simplified way to get the printer on your wireless network without even needing to enter the wifi password. I simply went through the setup on the printer, and then when it says to press the WPS button (within 120 seconds), press it (usually on the bottom of your router) and that was it. The printer was done configuring wireless. After the, a couple of steps to set the date/time/time zone, and I was done.Next, I added some paper to the tray and went into the Printer setup on my MacBook, picked the new Lexmark printer (it automatically appeared in the list of printers available), and I was done. I printed a page or two to test it, and also successfully printed from my iPhone X doing nothing more than selecting the Lexmark printer that automatically was listed as my (only) option to print (I don't have any other wireless printers online on my home network). Same story for my wife's laptop - absolutely seamless and simple setup.I have printed a few docs and other files so far, and am very impressed with the overall print quality. Sharp text, vibrant colors, and even pictures - which inexpensive laser printers are not really the best choice for printing on - look very good. And this is printing on stock office printer paper, nothing fancy. And I absolutely love having the option to print double-sided pages (duplex) without having to have the printer print on one side and then re-feed the paper into the printer upside down.Print speed is excellent, when warmed up this thing essentially prints instantly. When cold, it takes a few seconds - with a somewhat noisy fan kicking on - to get warmed up and then prints. Printing multiple pages is VERY fast for a light duty office printer. They claim 26ppm, or a page every ~2 seconds, and I have no doubt that is accurate.The only downsides I see are:-The printer is fairly heavy. The specs say about 35 pounds, but it almost feels heavier due to it's compact size.-Some of the construction feels a little cheap, in particular some of the plastic parts. When you open the toner door, you can feel a lot of flex in the plastic panel. And the plastic arms that allow the toner cartridge shelf to pull out feel very flimsy, like they would break if you pulled too hard. Nothing has actually broken yet, but some of these pieces could have been made of or reinforced with some metal.-There is no scanner. I know, this model is not sold as a MFP (multi-function printer), so I am not dinging it due to this. But keep it in mind if you need the option to use your printer as a copier.-The paper tray has to be extended out for legal size paper, making the depth of the printer a few inches more. (It took me a few minutes to figure out how this printer could accept legal size paper at all, like the product information states. The manual isn't very clear, but you need to extend the paper tray outward toward the front of the printer, and when you do this, the white plastic face plate actually sticks out further than when you are using letter size paper or smaller. If you want to print on 8.5x17 paper you have to use the manual feed slot just above the paper tray.)I cannot comment on how long the toner cartridges will last or the long term durability/reliability since I have only been using the printer for a few days. Should I discover anything in these areas that is an issue, I will update this review.From a print quality and performance, this gets a solid 5 stars for a ~$400 laser printer. I am dropping half of a one star from my overall rating due to the slight flimsiness in some of the plastic parts and the inability to handle paper larger than letter size from the print tray without making it stick out. That makes my overall rating 4.5 stars (rounding up to 5 for the Amazon review limitations).If you are looking for a solid laser print performer in a home office or small office with a small footprint, I highly recommend you consider this Lexmark C3426dw model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OORQH2V2YHPH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,6,0,No,
R35ZD0PWWYE2R1,"April 19, 2020",Walter,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, a little difficult to setup","We needed a color printer for our office and thought this would be a good choice. The small footprint is a huge plus since we have limited space. The initial setup was easy enough using my wife’s Chromebook and the printer’s touchscreen. But we had to use the included CD before the Windows 10 laptops would recognize it. That slowed things down considerably.Out of the box there is a lot of tape and tags to be removed, but there is an instruction sheet with pictures to show you where to find them. There is also a cd containing an app that needed to be installed on each of our Windows laptops before they could find the printer. There were no other instructions. It some tinkering and about an hour to get all 3 Win10 laptops to print anything so some instructions would have been nice. There was a very bothersome SMTP error that wouldn’t go away even once the printer was printing. I had to reboot the laptop and unplug the printer to resolve the issue.Once the setup was complete everything went smoothly. The printer works just fine printing single or double-sided pages in black and white or in color. Printing is relatively silent. The speed is good, but not great at 26 ppm. Hopefully the toner lasts as long as Lexmark claims as the biggest drawback to any printer is the cost of running it.As for quality it does a great job with text and graphics, but I wouldn’t recommend it for photos. We tested it by printing our multicolor brochures that contain some colorful infographics and backgrounds. These looked quite nice and are much higher quality that the inkjet we were using. I also tried printing a couple of photos, but they were lack-luster and rather dull. My inkjet does a much better job in that regard.One note about shipping: while the Amazon box was in good condition, the printer box inside was damaged. Fortunately, the printer was not.So far so good. I have another Lexmark printer that we stopped using before the end of the first week because it couldn’t print even a single page job without jamming.

So, really, no worries there.Overall, you're looking at less than 10 minutes set-up for most home offices, and no more than 25 for complex business settings.Functionally, I've yet to run across anything this doesn't do that is claimed in the overall product write-up.This is a somewhat compact all-in-one, but it's not necessarily small. With that said, it should fit well in most home offices and will certainly work in any business setting.Quality is very good. Printing is crisp, clear and without any manner of imperfections.The unit is fairly quiet, but not silent in operation.Overall, really, for the level this printer operates at, I find it to be one of the best options out there for home, small home office, small business, and medium sized business use.I'm very comfortable recommending this as a viable all-in-one solution.5 starsCheers!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23RYA7SP44GJ2?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,0,0,No,

We also have a smaller ""single function"" Brother and also a Canon laser printer for comparison.This generation of printers is faster, easier to set up and more flexible than earlier generations (any make).Size matters. Printers are used less often these days for most people, so having a smaller footprint is important.Apart from price, you may wish to consider whether you need a color laser printer, which gives you a nicer appearance for presentation handouts, but will require more and specialized consumables.PRO- Small footprint- Supports hardwired ethernet as well as wireless, USB- Well-placed network security- Color LCD to well thought-out cues to aid with setup (see photo).- Fast . Appears to meet or exceed promised print rate at single side.- Unclear whether this printer is field upgradeable.- Not measured, but this printer seemed to be a little more stingy with power during printing that our two Brother printers (which are >7 years old).- At least as good or better than our Canon laser printer (which jams now and then and can be difficult to clear)CON- Appears to be only 2.4 WiFi networks- Minor difficulty reseating the print cartridge during initial installation. There is an interlock that prevents you from proceeding.- Unclear how the field upgrades work if made available.- A lot of setup software is needed. For Windows 7 (obsolete), for instance, it could not find a suitable driver online. A completely web-based installer vs. the supplied CD might have been easier. That said, it worked OK, though it puts more running tasks into your system (tray, notifications, etc.).- In testing, noticed that after it had put itself to sleep, the printer would power itself up and go through a warming or self-test procedure (but not print anything.) May have been a one-off glitch.- The paper Quick Start Guide was not as helpful as the onboard setup tips.- Unclear if it's EnergyStar 3.0 (final version, February 2020)TIPS and REMARKSTo ease setting up WiFi, use the optional Lexmark app to assist in setting up the WiFi connection. The app will take over your network connection briefly for this purpose -- similar to what Alexa or Google Home devices do during setup.The Lexmark device allows you to skip setting up its admin password. Because this occurs so early in the setup, it's not clear what it's for. Once you have it working, be sure to go back and set it up; otherwise, it's a risk to your network.Recommend contacting Lexmark RE field upgrade options before purchasing.

R2DRQBEFVWVPBQ,"March 17, 2020",Walter,2,MB3442adw,Vine Customer,Biggest headache ever,"I ordered this for our new office since we didn’t have a printer yet. We (my wife and I) had been doing all the office printing at home on an inkjet.I tested it at home the day it arrived. The setup isn’t as quick and easy as Lexmark claims. There are no written instructions, just a page with pictures and arrows that seem to be trying to illustrate where all the packing tape is so you can remove it. There was plenty of that. When I removed the paper tray, a large piece came loose from underneath and fell off. It took several minutes to figure out how to reinstall that.Once I was sure all the tape was removed and got some paper loaded, I decided to try and go through the setup menu on the touch screen. It took about half a dozen attempts to navigate it correctly. It said something about using an app to set it up and I tried but was not successful. It wasn’t until I did a manual setup that I got it to work. Then the app (which I had installed on my phone) was able to find it.I used my phone to print several test pages (including a couple of images) and it printed them quickly. They were the high quality that you would expect from a laser printer.Lexmark is a reputable brand and I would expect this to be a printer that will last a long time. I would also expect good customer service (I was tempted to call during setup).I think we will be satisfied with it. I'm giving it only four stars due to the difficulty with the setup.UPDATE 04/02/2020:We have stopped using this printer. It began jamming during every print job. Repeat every print job. The worst part is that there really isn't any jammed paper. It is always a sheet that didn't eject properly, but I have to take the printer apart looking for the jam in order to clear the error code. This includes removing the paper tray which always causes a piece to fall out. To put it back together I have to turn the printer on its side. I have to do this every single time. It has been at least 10 days since I got a print job without a paper jam. I'm convinced the problem centers around the part that keeps falling out. But since there was no user guide or manual and I can't find this printer on Lexmark's website, I have no idea how to fix the problem.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DRQBEFVWVPBQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,8,1,No,

A software CD is included, but it wasn't needed for setup. Once we had it connected to our WiFi network, our Mac iOS and Linux computers recognized and operated it as a printer right away. The Mac recognized the scan function too.Speaking of scanning, this machine does both sheet fed scanning and flatbed scanning/copying/faxing. All functions are operable directly from the touch screen control panel (which is simple and intuitive) as well as from your computer.There are several connectivity options, including corded via USB or Ethernet cable, or WiFi wireless. The most secure means to print documents is via corded connection, but Lexmark includes ""full spectrum security"" as an option.I didn't put a timer on it to see if it really prints 42 pages per minute, but it is fast, and the print quality is of course laser printer sharp. And it does two-sided printing.There's a lot to like here. The only minor negative is that it is a monochrome printer (black toner only) and not full color. But I owned a color laser printer for years and was never too impressed with its color output or reproduction. I think ink jet printers are better at that. Laser printers excel at super sharp and cost effective black and white printing, and laser printed pages are water resistant---they don't smear and spread if a bit of water drops on them like ink jet ink tends to do.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19VCBQED4CYJ0?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VXTDQR,5,0,No,

It only includes a one page (two-sided) series of illustrations showing you were to remove all of the packing material.2. I went to the Lexmark website to find set-up instructions (driver is supplied as a CD-ROM, but none of my computers have a CD-ROM drive so I needed to download the drivers). Searching on their website for information yields no results for this model.3. Fumbling through the on-screen set-up, selecting to run initial set-up just returns you to the main menu. It doesn't do anything.4. The ""troubleshooting"" selection only has two choices. print test pages and cleaning the scanner5. Even a Google search for help turns up no results. Its like this printer doesn't even exist and is a figment of my imagination.6. Purchased a printer cable to connect directly to the computer. Finally found the correct driver on the Lexmark site and downloaded it (it isn't labeled for this specific model I ended up just selecting what appeared to be the newest driver available). Was finally able to print directly connected. Wi-Fi still won't set up, even though my Wi-Fi network was able to find the printer and connect it. Neither my laptop or my desktop can ""find"" the printer to connect via wi-fi.7. Keep getting an ""E-mail SMTP server not set up"" error message each time I print. When to the Embedded Web Server site and cannot see any way to get rid of the error. Cannot ""log in"" to the web server site because I do not have a log in set up. Google search returns results for how to get rid of the error, but you can't follow those directions without logging in, which I can't do.The print QUALITY, when it does print, is fine. It is possible I just got a bad unit and my problems are not indicative of the model overall.

I assume there was a missing step somewhere that was to allow the printer to access my local WiFi network. Since I have a wired ethernet as well as WiFi, I chose to make a wired connection so that I could go to the next step in the setup program. It did find the printer and that allowed me to go further. I did have to do a bit of troubleshooting to actually get it to print. I got some error message about something (SMTP?) not being set up. I kept trying to print and I thought it still wasn’t working until I went to the room where the printer was located and found that it had been printing and double sided at that. I seem to remember it asking me at some point if I used the wireless app to set up the printer. Since I didn’t have a wireless app that I was aware of, I said no.

R2IL5WOCYEQBP6,"April 19, 2020",Hyytekk,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Why do printer manufacturers assume everyone employs an IT department?,"Printers are supposed to be patient servants who sit idle, but snap to attention when you need them. They do seem too if you have a wired connection. Adding Wifi seems to reduce the printer's IQ by half. Unless you have your own IT department or a 12 year old close by to rescue you. Now that that's out of the way, here are my impressions of this Lexmark B3340 so far. I was looking for a replacement for my Cannon, that was most of all intuitive and whose Wifi just plain worked every time. Unboxing seemed promising but suspect since documentation included one sheet of printed media and a DVD. The single sheet of ""instructions"" contained no words, just a few cave wall drawings with a helpful bent page indicator in the lower right hand corner indicating the need to turn the page over to continue. Good thing, I never would have noticed it was printed on both sides! Step 12 indicates you need to turn the printer on. The final step indicates you insert the DVD into your laptop. If only laptops still had DVD readers. In my Apple world those are barely even remembered. So there we both sat in awkward silence.There is a tiny, single line display so I decided to break the ice and start pushing the few buttons there. It asked if I wanted to set it up using an app. Yes please. I downloaded the only Lexmark app I could find onto my phone, but that proved to be a dead end. I used my iMac to try to locate drivers for the B3340 and finally wading through microscopic online print and charts seemed to find what I needed so clicked the hyperlink for Mac. Nothing downloaded. I connected the printer to my desktop to see if that might make a love connection. I thankfully had the correct cable. Would have been nice if Lexmark had included one but maybe no one does that any more. Though others seem to make even a tiny effort to give you a modicum of direction. I opened my Printer preference tab, and by golly, it had recognized the new printer. Clicking on some options seemed promising but still no directions. I went back to that single line display and started clicking through and eventually found an option to connect to Wifi. It found my network thankfully and asked for my password. I hoped there might be a more handy input method. But no, you need to go through small a, capital A, small b capital B, etc. for each part of your password. Mine dutifully is 10 characters long so it was a lot of tapping. Eventually all was set up, and I directed the computer to print a page and selected the Lexmark. Thankfully it instantly printed the page, though the quality seemed a little light and non-crisp. Imagining there were internal adjustments I went back to single line display, but nothing there. In the mean time the printer went into sleep mode. I opened the Printer choices but nothing helpful there. After pushing the back arrow on the printer it said it was ""ready"" and fully awake. Thats when, in the Printer section under the ""general"" tab, there was a tiny box that said it would take you to the printer web site. I bit, and although it's not obvious at all, there are nests of settings that will adjust your printer, including print quality and darkness level. I made the adjustments, printed another page and the page was beautiful. I was interrupted but returned to make sure all was in order, tried to print another page but nothing. It said it couldn't find the printer. Ten minutes later, the page printed.Over all, this seems to be a solid relatively compact printer. It says it's made out of steel though the exterior seems like hard plastic. The single line of display gives basic information only after lots of clicking and little intuitive guidance. Once all is set up to the settings of your choice, it seems promising. I cancelled sleep mode but it still seems to doze off and not print wirelessly on command. I'll keep tinkering. In conclusion, unit build seems solid, compact and unencumbered by buttons and blinking lights. Five stars there. As for helpful setup directions or any guidance I would give it zero stars if possible. I believe this will prove to be a solid, reliable printer. As long as I don't need to wake it up by physically pushing a button on the controls, and the wifi proves reliable, I should be happy. If you're reading Lexmark, can't you simply include a second piece of printed instructions that gives a buyer even a scrap of guidance? At least for customers who exist in the Apple universe, or with Windows laptops that lack DVD access?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IL5WOCYEQBP6?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,13,1,No,

R1TXY9ZLWLJ9YF,"June 10, 2020",James,5,B3340dw,Verified Purchase,"The Lexmark 3340dw is a fast, no frills laser printer that won't break the bank.","As I write this, we are still very much in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and I suspect that will still be the case come November. Here in The Buckeye State we have to request an absentee ballot by sending an application via USPS. Since I do not intend to go to the polls in person, I chose to replace my worthless, broken, 6 year old Canon inkjet printer so that I could print out the ballot application. The old inkjet actually stopped functioning properly a few years ago, and I had limped along during that time relying on the printers at work for all of my printing needs. However, I am now working from home for the foreseeable future and do not want to don a mask and drive into the office just to pick up a piece of paper.My only requirement: I was determined to have a laser printer. I've had a string of inkjets that all did a number of things, like make copies or scan documents. All of them were doomed to be mediocre at best at any task assigned to them, but the clincher is that they always stopped working after about 3 or 4 years. What's more, they are incredibly slow. The Canon for instance liked to spend about 2 full minutes making a bunch of noises, gears turning, beeps beeping, lights flashing, and that was before it even pulled a sheet of paper out of the tray. Once it finally started printing, it was like watching a JPEG download on dial-up. All that is to say that inkjets suck, and the old Canon has a date with my trusty metal bar a la the dreaded fax machine in the movie Office Space.This printer fit the bill for me. The bulk of my printing needs are things like the aforementioned ballot application, or airline boarding passes. For that reason, I don't really see a need for color unless you are doing graphics or photos. I also have a phone with an excellent camera. It can capably scan a document into PDF form, and I can print that PDF to my hearts content on my new laser printer. For that reason, I also saw no need to have a copier or scanner attached to my printer. This printer does the one thing I need it to do, and it does it fast. How fast, you ask? There is a span of about 1.5 seconds between hitting the print button and retrieving a completed printout from the printer. Perhaps this is average performance for a laser printer? Eh, what do I know? I mainly bought it because it had 5 star reviews and was pretty much the cheapest option.As for installation, I would recommend going to the Lexmark site first and downloading the documentation. The one page installation guide that comes in the box is clearly meant for an international audience (think IKEA), due to it being a series of slightly confusing pictographs that lacked any meaningful text instructions. If you want to print from any computer running windows 10 then you will want to go to the Lexmark site again, and download and install the driver first, presuming of course that you do not have a cd-rom drive to use the included install disk (it is 2020 after all). I tried installing without the installation software on my windows 10 desktop, and it inverted the color so that it printed a black background with white text. Obviously that will use up your toner in a hurry. My Macs on the other hand worked perfectly with AirPrint. Also, get the mobile app to set it up. The on-device interface is where I suspect they cut corners to get the price so low, and the app is faster and easier by far. Once you've done that, you can administer the printer settings via it's web server on a browser, which has no such shortcomings as the on-device interface. Last recommendation, setup security so your wannabe hacker neighbors don't decide to do it for you, and lock you out of your own printer.This printer is my first Lexmark, and it has exceeding my expectations so far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a similar use case to mine. However the jury is still out on the longevity of the device, due to a lack of a sufficient amount of time passing or an ability to divine the future, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TXY9ZLWLJ9YF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,25,0,No,

However I have had two problems with it, first of all from one of my windows 10 computers it prints black as white and white as black and I have tried many things to try and find a solution but I just can't and at this point I'm scared of trying any other fixes because it is just running though my ink. From my other computers both windows and Mac devices it works fine. Second the mobile set up didn't work for me so I had to connect my printer though a ethernet cable which you need to have on hand. This process is much less intuitive and if you don't know how to do it i'm sure there are tutorials online but it would have been nice if Lexmark provided some more simple instructions on how to use the printer. Overall as of now with a bit of work I have a great working printer with the exception of that one computer, if your willing to go through that work its a good printer but because of the extra unnecessary trouble I had to go thorough I would recommend looking at some other options.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24HD2VPO9WZTN?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,3,2,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review.

Opening the box, there are not many instructions. There is a two sided piece of paper with pictures only which I found a little confusing. There is a CD included by I don’t have a CD drive so I didn’t use this software. It wasn’t needed to setup to print from a MAC or PC wireless.There is a very tiny and dim LCD screen on the printer which is kind of useless. I went through the setting and it asked if I wanted to setup with the mobile app so I did that. It is the Lexmark Mobile Assistant App and I found it easily on the iPhone App Store.I wanted this to be a network printer rather than hardwired locally to one of my PCs. I chose the wireless connection since my router is not near where I wanted the printer. If you are using a printer or ethernet connection you need to provide the cable.This printer does not support 5GHZ network, which I find surprising on a new printer.The app was very easy to use to setup the printer on my network. I was able to easily add the printer to my MAC. It was almost as easy to add to my wife’s Windows PC, but for some reason it couldn’t find the printer at first and I had to refresh the list again and then it found it. Once found, it took a little bit of time for Windows to setup but once complete it was ready.The printer is very fast and produces decent output.

It will recognize the network quickly and connect easily with the correct information.Do not print the setup page unless you really need to otherwise you may waist around 5 sheets of paper.

As well a provide you with info on the life of the Maintenance Kit, and toner level of the print cartridge. You can also set up alerts for diffent printer issues and device conditions. You can also set up for remote printing power management Etc.Over all this printer is a great addition to our office and saves us time and I believe in the long run will also save us money.

RA4TT0RCQT8VK,"March 27, 2020",Robert J. Newell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"Fast, Good Print Quality, Easy to Hook Up, But Where's the Toner?","Let's be clear, it's a good printer. It was easy to set up, has decent features, and the print quality is good.Setup: cabled setup is easy, although if you're not going to go wireless, you'll have to supply your own cable, whether USB or Ethernet. I won't dock them for that, although they could have said ""cable not supplied"" in their writeups. This just worked out of the box on my Linux system. For Windows, you should probably download drivers from the Lexmark support site. Not sure about Mac.Wireless setup is accomplished from the little display window on the printer. I've always found this annoying but if you run Windows and want to install their software you can avoid this. But there is nothing hard about it, just a little tedium, and it works as it should, although I always prefer the Ethernet option. (Tip: on your router, assign a fixed IP address to the printer. This makes life easier for non-USB connections.)Okay, how does it work? Just fine. Double sided printing is wonderful, print quality is great, speed is about what you'd expect today--- in other words, very good for a home printer used by a few people. (Don't expect to use this in a 20 person office, though.) It's a light-duty printer, very suitable for a home office.Build quality is good. Don't drop it off tall buildings, but don't be afraid to move it around or carry it around. It should stand up just fine.Now, the one gripe. Toner. It comes with the plague of printers in pretty much the last decade, the dreaded ""starter"" cartridge. This is a cartridge that is maybe 10% full, meaning you have to buy a real cartridge almost right away. And guess what, the cartridge price is in the same range as the printer price in most cases. Manufacturers don't have to make money on the printer, they make it on the cartridge.The ""starter"" is supposed to be good for 500 pages, about one ream. If that holds up, depending on your needs, you might get a week or two in a busy home office, and maybe a month or two of really casual use.So you better order that cartridge. You go to the Lexmark site and ... oh my, they aren't selling them. Maybe a little later on? Better hope so, or pretty soon you'll have a brick. This is 100% inexcusable. And comparing similar Lexmark printers, the cartridge will be over a hundred dollars. Wow.Usually there are 3rd-party cartridges, often for about 15% of the price. That's what I always buy for my other printers; I find a reputable vendor and buy from them. But you cannot get the cartridge for this printer anywhere at the time of this writing (late March 2020).I'm going to provisionally rate the printer four stars. After all, it's a very good product. I would have gone five if the cartridges were available at a fair price. I will revisit this later. If in a month or two you still can't get the cartridge, the rating will be one star.Followup in June 2020: Toner is now available from the manufacturer (pretty expensive) and from at least one third party (a little less expensive but still not cheap).",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4TT0RCQT8VK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,11,0,No,

Wireless setup was very quick and easy. I like Lexmark's Unison toner. It separates the toner cartridge and the imaging unit unlike other toner cartridges where the units are combined. The Unison toner cartridge doesn't need shaking to equalize printing and prints at lower temperature than previous types of toner, so that means lower energy costs as well as quicker printing from a cold start. My only issue is probably due to this being a new item that I received through the Amazon Vine program. There is no online documentation specific to this model and I have been unable to determine the toner replacement cartridge for this unit.

RU29785I48QOO,"March 18, 2020",LifeIsGood,5,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Speedy monochrome for the small or home office,"This compact laser printer (8 3/4"" H x 14"" W x 14"" D) does just one thing, but it does it very well. From sleep to first page out is under 10 seconds and pages print at the advertised speed, even using the duplexer, which I love. The picture instructions are bad, and there is nothing else, but once you get the printer out of the box they kind of make sense. This does not come with any cables other than power, so if you want to connect other than wirelessly you will need an Ethernet cable to connect to your network or a printer cable (with that squarish connector) to connect to your computer. I opted for wireless as I wanted to test this with my Android tablet as well. Once you power on the printer you have to use the 2-line monochrome screen to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that if you connect to a network it has to be 2G and not 5G. The driver for this is not on the Lexmark site as of this review, so I had to use the CD (I tried with the Windows driver and the pages printed like a negative, but the Lexmark software fixed that).

RX72XBHQ26O0T,"March 16, 2020",Man in the Middle,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Very fast and works well. PC setup is easy. Mac setup is manual.,"The first thing I noticed on setting up this new printer is that it came with only one page of pictorial setup info, and no manual. It did include a driver CD, but my iMac running Catalina couldn't find any files it could run on that. In addition, searching the Lexmark website found no useful information about this new B3442dw model (though I did find a brochure about its likely predecessor, the B2442dw.)Fortunately, I was easily able to set the printer up properly anyway. Just remove all the packing materials both around the toner cartridge and on the outside of the case, load some paper, and power the printer on. A built-in small display will talk you through the needed initial settings, including entering a password to join your WiFi network. From there it was simple to tell my iMac to add a printer, and chose that one from the bonjour list that appeared. Once set up, its Options & Supplies button in the driver allows all other settings to be seen and customized easily.Since I do also have a Windows 10 laptop PC (Dell Inspiron XPS 15), I WAS quickly and easily able to install a driver on that, using the included CD.Once a driver was installed, printing on both the iMac and the Dell was a simple matter of choosing the Lexmark printer for a document. The result was blazingly fast (I've never seen such quick duplex printing before), and good quality.Overall, this is an excellent printer, lacking only a bit more attention to documentation to be fully ready for prime time on Macs in addition to Windows PCs.Update: Just discovered an interesting problem. For no obvious reason, the link to this printer at IP address 192.168.1.26 has also taken over the link to my Western Digital MyCloudEx2Ultra at IP address 192.168.1.2. Attempting to open a Web page at 192.168.1.2 shows the printer's web page, the same as if I'd opened the page at 192.168.1.26. And the MyCloud can't be accessed unless the printer is powered off. Those two addresses should NOT be in conflict, but somehow are. I'll update once I figure it out.Update 2: No toner is listed as available yet for this printer, either here at Amazon or at the maker's website. Whether the toner for the earlier model B2442dw would also work on this new model is unknown.

R2558N1P0X0T8S,"March 15, 2020",Eric L.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Full Featured Networkable Printer,"The printer does not seem to come with a USB cable. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one on hand or buy one. Or at least mine didn’t come with any cables other than power. That was ok for me because I am using Ethernet and I have a bunch of spare Ethernet cables, and there is also wireless connectivity available. But USB likely the easiest way to get up and running for non-techies, so if this is you, have a spare printer cable lying around, or purchase one with the printer. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one or buy one.Once unpacked and set up following the crude pictograms included, it was necessary to download the drivers and install them. The unit does come with a CD installer disk, but even if you have an antique computer with an optical drive, it makes more sense to go to the Lexmark website and download the latest drivers. Who knows how old the ones on the CD are?After plugging the printer into my switch using Ethernet, and running the installer, the software could not find the printer, nor was it listed by my router as being connected (though the Ethernet activity lights on the printer were flashing). Eventually, I noticed that the small LCD display on the top of the printer had some questions about time, date, and language that must be answered on the printer before it will even show up on the network. After completing the setup on the small LCD screen, the printer was connected but the installer still could not find it. Instructions would have been helpful here, especially for people who aren’t technically inclined, but you can probably find help online.It was necessary for me to go to my router’s web page, get the printer’s DHCP provided IP address, and plug that into the installer manually in the “advanced set up” area. Also, it asks for you to manually type in the port name. I typed in “Ethernet” (no quotes) and it worked, the installer was able to proceed. After doing this on my main computer, I went back to the router and assigned a fixed IP address to the printer so that I will have no trouble finding it when I install the driver on my laptop and other computers.The software itself is nice and compact. I have a Canon printer that came with software that’s all up in your face all the time… meaning, it came with a bunch of bloatware like scrapbooking apps and card making apps and a bunch of docks and control panels that I had to carefully remove after writing the review. In the case of this Lexmark, it’s all business and it’s not in your face at all, and I appreciate that.The printer is fast and quiet. Over Ethernet, when I send a page the printer, it’s done printing before I can even start wondering how long it will take. Coming from an inkjet printer, this is really nice. Also, the network connectivity is indispensable these days. It certainly is if you have two or more devices in your life that you’d like to print from. That network connectivity also makes it easy to tweak the settings as the printer publishes a web page that you can reach from any web browser (if connected to from your local network). Just type the IP address of the printer into your browser and the settings page comes up. By the way, this is another good reason to assign a static IP to the printer; you can then just add a bookmark to your browser. That administrative web page allows you to change many parameters in several categories. Some of the settings are beyond my paltry comprehension, but there is a lot there that is useful to me, and some of it I’m sure is useful to IT personnel deploying these things on larger networks. There are a lot of IT tweaks and settings available here.The printer is handsome looking and compact, and it feels durable and professional. I think it will be perfect for my home office. Every computer I have can now print quickly and quietly from anywhere in the house.The unit comes with a toner cartridge that is described as a “starter cartridge.” It’s not clear to me how many pages we will get out of this; also, at the time of writing this, I couldn’t find replacement cartridges on Amazon or on the Lexmark site. No doubt they will be rolling these out soon; I just hope it’s sooner than my “starter cartridge” lasts. When available, I expect the replacement cartridges to cost well north of $100 each.I remember when laser printers cost a couple thousand dollars each, and then you had to pay extra for network connectivity. The price of this one is very appealing. In fact, it seems like a steal at this price. Just don’t forget that they get you on the toner, same as inkjet makers get you on the ink. There’s still no free lunch.Other than that, I’m delighted with this little printer.

R10V9WCIQS76AL,"March 14, 2020",Summit,1,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"FAST! Love it!  ***UPDATED: Didn't last through starter toner...  it's dead, Jim!","*********EDITED MAY 2020: It didn't make it through the tiny starter toner. It connects to the network, it just refuses to print with no indication why. I'm a retired network engineer and have dealt with the nastiest of printer problems on networks and repaired printers in the field with paperclips, soldering iron and sheer anger. This one stopped working rather early on and can only print it's own configuration- no other print jobs will work and nothing more of an error than it just ""can't print"" the job. My last Lexmark was an utter failure, too... and this one will now join it as I have to PAY to recycle them both. As of today, replacement toner is not available anywhere- even from Lexmark unless I mail in the empty one first to refill. I'm done with Lexmark after decades of buying dozens and dozens of their enterprise printers at a time.**************This is a no-frills, monochrome printer without all the fancy touch-screen nonsense. What it does, it does perfectly- spit out paper quickly.I print a LOT while I'm working on some business plans, consulting and getting my MBA just for giggles despite being retired. My color laser eats toner as if it is free and it most certainly isn't. Having a monochrome, fast, two-sided printer as a default is the best idea ever... save that color printing for when it's actually necessary. It's surprising how often one does NOT need color, and the cost savings of not wasting printing in color is significant.I set this up without looking at directions, as I always do. Initially, it didn't detect ANY WiFi networks in my house when there are actually five of them. This was odd, but after several tries it started to see them. I had to go through typing the password through the simple buttons and simple display three times, but it finally connected and all is well.There is an app for this as well as computer software, but I chose to do everything without adding yet another app or yet another bit of software on my computer. It's likely far easier to do it with the apps etc- so unless you're just a glutton for punishment like me, just use their app.When it came time to print, this is when I became a big fan... it spits paper like crazy! I set it to print a large document, four pages per side, double sided... and wow, it was racing through it so much faster than any other printer I've had. SUPER fast at getting prints done. The print quality is fantastic, too. Double-sided printing saves SO much paper and space, too.Lexmark has always been one of my favorite printer suppliers, mostly known for their commercial machines. My last Lexmark was a color laser which was a complete disaster and never worked well at all. It ended up being recycled without ever having a successful print. Lexmark has redeemed themselves with this one- it's a business class machine that will absolutely STUN you with how fast it can put out pages. The ads say 42 pages per minute... which is faster than what I got, but plausible.Bravo, Lexmark. There are cheaper printers out there, but this one delivers performance that is worth every penny.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10V9WCIQS76AL?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,2,0,No,

We were not able to find drivers online for this printer, and we looked for over 15 minutes. It simply should not be that hard to find something necessary for the use of the product. You can use the ones for Windows 10 but it won’t support all the features. What’s the point?I’m not wild about the necessity of using CD-ROMs, which do come with this. Newer machines usually don’t support CDs. Also, with CDs, they will usually not include the most up to date drivers.

R2HIYF66AQ9YY4,"November 5, 2019",Sheena Cousar,5,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,I can't believe this doesn't have all 5 stars!,"Just received this today, so it is possible over time I may change my mind, and if I do, I'll update this review. But it is awesome so far!I'm replacing a 20-year-old high-end Brother printer, so I'll compare it to that. The Brother cost $600 20 years ago, so I was not expecting much at all from a $117 printer.Most of the negative reviews mentioned trouble connecting via WiFi. My first thought was I didn't care about that. I've never had a WiFi printer in the past and didn't see any reason it would be necessary now. However, I have gotten married since 20 years ago and we have kids and more computers in the house, so I figured if it worked that would be great and if not, well, it was only $117 and we didn't have a networked printer in the past so it would be okay.Of course, once it arrived, connecting it to WiFi became my first obsession! I guess I just wanted to try it that cool new feature!I've never connected a printer to WiFi and wasn't sure how it worked. The printed materials that came with the printer were totally useless. It's all pictures, no words and nothing about connecting via Wifi. But, all the info you need, really, is on the printer screen. Even though it's tiny, I was able to get the information I needed from it to connect it up.Basically, I turned the printer on, read the directions as they scrolled across on the tiny screen and followed the directions. It mentioned a Lexmark printer app, which I downloaded. I was able to quickly and easily connect the app on my phone to the printer and from there it was a breeze. It went through the steps and I was able to print from my phone. Which again, was not something I had ever imagined doing, much less anything I needed or wanted to do. But it worked and that was cool!Then it was off to connect two computers to it. First I plugged it in by wire to my wife's computer - which I think might have been a mistake. But at the time I thought that's how you had to do it. For some reason I wasn't able to get it to connect via WiFi on her computer because while the computer ""saw"" the printer, it kept asking me for a WPS PIN which it said was either printed on the printer or was on the printed materials that came with the printer. It was on neither.I gave up on that and went to install it via WiFi only on my computer. Actually I didn't really have to do anything. I opened the Printer Settings on my computer and clicked Add Printer, then find WiFi connected printer and it was right there. So it was already broadcasting the signal to all devices in our house and all I had to do was click Connect - and it worked like a charm. The weird thing though is it didn't ask me for any WPS PIN for my computer. And I'm guessing that's because I never connected it via wire - so it didn't halfway install itself by wire only to get confused by WiFi? I don't know. But I did not ever attach it to my computer with a wire and the WiFi connected up absolutely flawlessly.Then I went back to my wife's computer and using the disk that came with the printer I installed the drivers from that. And once that was done, suddenly it worked fine as a WiFi printer. Although it shows up in Printer Settings as (copy1) of the first attempted installation by wire, which still works if it's plugged in with the wire.Then for the big test. I moved the printer to another room! Would we both be able to print on it from our respective offices? My wife's office is closest and mine is further away... about 50 feet away and several drywall walls. From my wife's office, everything went off without a hitch. From my office - same result. Print Perfect both times.My old $600 Brother printer did excellent color prints, and this one does as well - for 1/6th the price. I printed a few photos from the Lexmark, as a test, and was absolutely amazed at their quality. They're almost photo-printer quality. In fact, if I printed them on laser photo paper, I think they'd look good enough to frame and hang.The other nifty feature is the double-sided print feature. Maybe this is something that's been common among printers for the last few years, I'm not sure. But if you're not used to it, it's very cool. It will print on both sides of the paper - automatically. In other words, you don't have to print on one side and then stick the page in upside down and print the other side manually anymore. It will print the first side, then suck the page back into the printer and print the other side! It's really amazing to watch if you've never seen a printer do this before. And it's so fast.One other plus factor is that it's much smaller and lighter than our old printer. The old one, I literally can't lift by myself it's so darn heavy. Something around 100 pounds I think. But this one is much easier to lift, it's like a heavy suitcase. We also appreciate that it takes up much less space than the old behemoth did.One con so far... they include about 7 or 8 sheets of paper (printed on both sides - that's 16 pages of printing) with nothing other than safety warnings - in every imaginable language. The length of the English text wouldn't take up more than about 2 paragraphs, not even a full page. So it's a colossal waste of paper they include and completely unnecessary. Not to mention the hassle they cause all their customers with so much extra paper they have to throw out. BIG WASTE. I have to think that the United States is their largest market and as such might warrant it's own version of this in English and perhaps Spanish. But no... they literally had to print it in almost every major language on earth - and send it in every major language to every customer! Totally ridiculous, wasteful and annoying.The only instructions are what looks like a hand-drawn diagram with little arrows drawn here and there. Not a single word printed on these two pages - where words would be extremely helpful. Apparently the folks at Lexmark don't want to *offend* anyone by writing in the language/languages spoken in the United States only, so they opt not to print any words at all. As if instructions in English might offend people! Like the United States is such a small market it's not worth their time and effort to print in English and Spanish.Other than that big annoyance though, we're both very pleased with this purchase. I'm still amazed at all the complaints - and really surprised it has only a 3.7-star review score. That's way below where it should be in my humble opinion.I have seen some reviewers say it worked well at first but after a few weeks it went bad. So, if that happens here, I'll come back and definitely adjust my score accordingly, and revise my review to let you know.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HIYF66AQ9YY4?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,238,3,No,

It took me longer to take it out of the box than to set it up. I did not use the app, I just plugged it in and used the printer display panel. Took less than 10 minutes from start to finish. I do recommend updating the firmware right after setting it up. It still blows my mind that I am able to buy an excellent quality laser COLOR printer at this price.Print quality is very good. Color saturation and coverage is uniform and rich. I read reviews that complained about how noisy the printer is. That has not been my experience. I only print wireless from Mac, iPhone and Windows without any connectivity problems.I had one problem. Out of the box the printer was printing a series of dots lined vertically 1/2 inch from the right edge, spaced exactly one inch apart on every page. I called Lexmark support who quickly had me run printer diagnostics (again, from the printer display panel). He determined that the problem was caused by the black toner cartridge. He shipped me a new cartridge (full size, not the starter one!), which solved the problem. While it was disappointing to have a problem like this on a brand new printer, Lexmark made up for it. I hope the printer will last for at least 3-4 years, but only time will tell.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XNDMPRWETDW3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,

Nelson,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,No Aftermarket Toner!!,"3 Month Update: I have run low on toner and just discovered there is no aftermarket/generic toners available. I can buy Lexmark high yield toner package for $350 or standard yield for $275. I think I will throw this printer in the garbage and buy something new. I cannot afford toner that expensive, I had just assumed there is always an aftermarket of generic toners, but this printer must not sell in high enough numbers for aftermarket companies to make toners. It will be cheaper for me to throw this away and buy another brand printer that does have aftermarket toners available.Original Review: Home printers are throw away items. They usually don't last more a year, if they do, they need new rollers, drums, etc that cost more than a new printer. My Canon Imageclass MF634cdw was flawless for one year. Got it loaded and up and running in 20 minutes. After one year it started making awful grinding noises and printing badly, etc. Time for something new.This was only $114 and has the auto duplex function. It lacks the all-in-one document feeder and scanner, but I can still use that on my old Imageclass. Setup was difficult (much harder than my Canon was), and the printer could not be detected on my wifi, so I had to google how to load a print driver using an IP address. I've never done this before. Took me about 5 hours to set this printer up on my 2 computers (desktop & laptop), but it prints quickly and quietly. Auto duplex works perfect. After 5 days, it has not gone offline, not had any paper jams, no issues at all.I will update this if I have any issues, but after 5 days, despite some annoyances in getting it up and running, I am very please for only $114.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVJ0L3I075N0B?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,6,0,No,

You just need to make sure that you connect the Wifi to the printer first through the printer control panel then proceed with downloading the appropriate drivers/apps for your device. I found it really easy to connect the devices actually. My Google phone and Chromebook latched on immediately. I could see how others could have issues figuring this out though. I'm fairly tech savvy but it still took me a few minutes of fiddling. I don't understand the lack of included instructions out of the box or online. You really just need a small note card that could walk you through it but nothing, weird. The printing software is nothing to write home about and typically no frills.2. Quality for text is very good of course since it's a laser. Photos are okay. They aren't as poppy or crisp as most inkjets in the same price range but it's passable, at least for my needs. I didn't expect too much for the photo printing (due to reviews I read) but it actually met or exceeded my expectations. If photos are your main interest then you shouldn't be looking at a laser anyway.3. Although this is compact compared to other laser printers, it's not exactly small. It takes up as much space as a small multifunction inkjet. The advantage is that I can shove this unit into a shelf because it doesn't have a scanner top that you need to lift. I realized over time that I use a scanner maybe once a year so I wanted forgo that function.Initially, I am super happy with this. The price is amazing!! It does exactly what I need it to do for use as a basic office printer. I've been buying inkjets all my life. I hope that I don't have to deal with clogged printer heads ever again. I was also weary of buying a 'Lexmark' since there is very little hype about this brand. But I love the no frills design and function of this unit. If I encounter issues then I will update this review. Otherwise, assume this thing is still kicking butt.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JJXVDPKZCTPB?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,11,0,No,

STILL ON THE HUNT...,"UPDATE 3.21.20I went to print on the printer for the second time since printing after set up the first day I opened this printer. I saw the same problem as I did with my previous printer. The print quality is splotchy and blurry. Part of the page didn't even print. I tried darkening the toner in the settings - same issue, no difference. I tried doing a test print - even the test print was splotchy and not clear but the very last page said no issues with cartridge. Amazon customer service said try replacing the toner (which would have cost me HUNDREDS of dollars) which was ridiculous. I am still on the hunt for just a decent printer...I am starting to question if there are any good printers out there any more.I tried another brand before this and was an awful experience printing and trying to return it. I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this. Not enough to send back because the printer is so quick and sharp, but a bit annoyed my colors on the screen won't come out on the page exactly.

First i had plugged it in follow the pictures that were given for instructions. (Note: there is no words for the instructions) After i had done so i downloaded the app that it told me to however in the Google play store i did not download the Lexmark printer assistant app which i needed to set it up. I had downloaded the Lexmark print app which was not of help since the printer was not even connected to my WiFi at this point. It took me a good 2 hours just to figure that part out. Then after getting the printer on the WiFi network and all set up on the phone i go to set up on the computer. I have an HP running windows 10 home edition. It took me 4 hours just to get the drivers installed onto the computer and for it to recognized that i had a printer on the WiFi network. I can get test page to print just fine however what i had printed for an actual test print did not print it said error printer offline. The printer clearly says on the little 2 line screen ""Ready"". I started this task at 10:30 am Arizona time it is now 9:33 pm and what i had sent to the printer as a test print is now being printed on its own without my computer being on. Now if only it would print when i tell it to and print the full page not just a half page like the picture i uploaded for reference.

R2KF2JGQCYP5DZ,"June 8, 2020",Nielo,2,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Buy something else,"The final edit of how I feel about this printer.BUY SOMETHING ELSE!The printer is barely OK but the toner cartridges, at about $100 each for each color, are phenomenally expensive. The starter cartridges that come with the printer will give you maybe 100 pages after which you'll have to spend almost $400 for replacements that say they're good for 1500 pages. So far I can't find anybody to supply re-manufactured or some other kind of alternate.Everything below this line is my first impression.The pro.I set the printer up connected directly to my computer via USB so I can't comment on other setups. The USB setup was simple, just install the CD and run it.The tiny screen on the printer is adequate for the job.The con.The print quality is a puzzle.I unboxed and removed all the shipping tape and printed a few pages. I was very disappointed and thought I'd have to send the printer back. The problem was the density of the print was very inconsistent with some very light places and some almost ok. It was late and I figured I'd try a few more pages the next day and see if there were some print quality adjustments I could make. I didn't get to the printer until late the next day and, without doing anything, printed a few pages, some just black text and some schematics that contained a few colors. Those prints were very good. So, the puzzle is what changed that allowed the printer to work properly?One other thing is the envelope printing is a little off, at least using Word (2016). When the envelope is printed part of the return address doesn't get printed because it's off the envelope. Moving the address about a half inch in the envelope set-up corrects the problem, but the correction doesn't persist so it needs to be set every time. There may be a more elegant fix, I have to play with it.My conclusion, now that the print quality has gotten better, is I'm pleased with the purchase.Update:When you print a document that is only black the print is lousy. If the page has any color on it the black print, and the color print, is very good.One more update then I'm done:I went to the printer settings and changed the quality/toner darkness from the default ""Use Printer Settings"" to ""Use Toner Darkness"" and printed a page. Actually, I printed 7 pages of all black text. The problem went away. Then, I switched back to the original ""Use Printer Settings"" and printed the same 7 pages again. The problem seems to have gone away with this setting too. My guess is the printer had to calibrate itself.Last but not least, there's a software update I may install.

We've had the Lexmark C3224dw for a couple of months now. The price was great, and the print quality is solid (see attached gift card I just printed out). I will say the setup was kind of a pain. But now that its setup, I've had zero issues printing wireless from any of my devices.

R1IMP2SWI3PY7T,"June 7, 2020",US-Gaming reviews,4,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Great for home office use I would not suggest using this for business,"So firstly I want to start off by saying there are a lot of negative reviews on this that are literally unjustified. These are usually problems with the toner cartridge or people fail to properly follow the directions on initial setup. In addition I can vouch that the Wi-Fi on this does work flawlessly with almost every device I've used it on I have yet to test it with Alexa but we'll be doing so after I write a skill set for it. I have enclosed a bunch of photos a picture of the Disney Castle is printed on Plain paper and the other image was printed on photo paper So now onto my review...So in this review I'm going to address three areas the printer quality, the print quality, and the cost of use. First let's start with the overall quality this seems to be like every other laser printer as far as the overall housing internal components seem to be primarily plastic which is normal 4 most printers in its class. It does not come with a USB plug although one can be purchased. It does come with a power cord. The toner tray slides out from the front and the clips that lock the toner in place are made out of plastic so over a long. Of time they could present a problem and possibly break off. I would not say this is a deal-breaker. Does printer stands 9 in tall and is 16 in wide and is approximately 15 and 1/2 in deep. It contains built in Wi-Fi and has a port for ethernet. This has a port for USB but does not contain the USB cord itself. In addition does does have a manual feeder tray which is located in the front and it also has the automatic sheet feed tray which is just under it . You can print small photographs using 4 x 6 in Premium Photo Paper . But I have not tried anything smaller than this as far as paper is concerned . Envelope printing is also excellent and will leave absolutely zero creases in the envelope compared to most other Laser Printers. This comes with for starter toner cartridges which come already in the printer. You must follow the setup directions very closely to avoid damaging the product. This does come with a CD with drivers and software. Now moving on to the print quality compared to some of the competitors this print quality is actually really decent when compared to Samsung HP and brother Laser Printers in its class.. this printer that I received had very limited instructions which I was kind of surprised at. Especially for Lexmark. In my eyes this look like a factory recert where they had printed documentation off of a printer and enclosed it. But none the less was very easy to set up and all of the user manuals and Owner Manuals can be downloaded directly from Lexmark website. Moving on to the value I only gave this three stars for a couple of reasons first the product as compared to others of its class is very cheap I think I paid approximately $140 for this whereas most printers in this class range about $200 or more so that in itself is a great deal moving on to the second reason after doing an ample amount of research I have found that the toner cartridges are quite expensive to replace. For a refill directly from Lexmark it cost approximately $70 per cartridge. Other sites I have found the refill toner cartridges to be anywhere from $200 per set, up to literally almost $400 for the set of cartridges. in addition to this if you have the knowledge to do so you can purchase a toner refill kit. I have found the cheapest price to be approximately $70 this includes all four colors however the caveat is there is no toner reset chip available at this time. Although several reviews for toner refill on this specific printer have all said that it will let you print even after the chip is considered depleted I feel you must research it yourself once the toner chips are made available they are very easy to replace and you could reuse your toner cartridges for a long time. On that note I would say for a general home office printer this is a very good purchase if you are planning on purchasing this for business use I would suggest not going with this printer and going with a brother as the toner cartridges and chips are much cheaper and they have been in business far longer than Lexmark and their parts are made with much higher quality with businesses in mind.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IMP2SWI3PY7T?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,

Tech support has been mediocre too. The first tech support person said he would call back when he couldn't figure it out, and never did. The next day, I went through all the steps again for more than an hour, requiring a call back again. As I was packing up the printer to return he called back so I took it back out and he was able to troubleshoot it. Then I decided to give up renting a router and set up a purchased router and modem. So here we go again. After several hours and another call back, the tech person was talking to another tech person. Just as the additional tech person was getting remote access to my laptop, he decided to take a 10 minute break! This was my breaking point. I STILL continued to work with them, and you know what? Its STILL NOT WORKING!
