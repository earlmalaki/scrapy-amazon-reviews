R1ZXX4FBQ0ICWS,"June 1, 2020",COLLEY BALDWIN,2,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Would not buy.,It’s only the 3rd month and there is a horrible noise when it runs the pages,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZXX4FBQ0ICWS?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,
R2FEMBBF0JJV9T,"May 31, 2020",Tiffanie Coleman,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Setup/Installation is Horrible,"Why didn't I read more reviews and answered questions before I made this purchase? This was one of the most frustrating installations I've ever had. I had to download 2 different Lexmark apps to attempt to connect via Wifi and that didn't work. I have a Mac and I downloaded the drivers and nothing worked. After over 2 hours of trying, the next day I purchased a USB cord to make a connection and that worked. The test page was a blurry joke AND I don't want to use a cord in order to print. Can't wait until Monday when UPS picks up this monstrous printer and ships it back!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FEMBBF0JJV9T?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R3DBHB0GJPAYUV,"May 29, 2020",MBA grad,2,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,"WIFI connection issues and huge setup issues, print cartridges are expensive","I really made an effort to connect but the printer has serious WIFI connectivity issues. Setup was 2 days of hassle and then once I partially got it working, the printer would go sleep and disconnect from the network and my computer. Tech support said to set up a static IP address but would not tell me how to do that because I need to call Netgear (maker of my router). What a HUGE pain.The instruction manual was a joke of some photocopied pics (no words) and scanning the QR page took me to support but not drivers. They do give you a CD with drivers but who has a CD player anymore. Finally, the printer comes with ""starter"" laser cartridges that are almost empty. New ones are close to $300 on amazon. The print quality was good for plain paper. The last thing is it looks like I received a returned printer because I noticed finger print smudges on menu. Other user probably had similar issues.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DBHB0GJPAYUV?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,
R3EI7J7R0OQTUL,"May 29, 2020",Lauren SanFilippo,5,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Awesome printer !,Printer makes clean clear prints.

R2BY853E5HQ018,"May 28, 2020",Sean/Dad,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,$75-$100+ PER toner cartridge for replacements.,"Yeah I was a fool.I didn't check the toner prices first.The manufacturer's website shows $65 for the Black, and $75 for each color, + shipping + tax.Everywhere else is more expensive.There's no copy-cat toner for this that I see.BEING SHOWN color toner at reasonable prices while buying this... toner that is INCOMPATIBLE with this printer... is the hallmark of the crappy suggestion AI/engine found here... and drives people like me up the wall.If I am LOOKING for a specified IN-THE-FILTER brand, I don't want to see another.If I am LOOKING at a specific MODEL, DON'T SHOW ME SUPPLIES for other MODELS!It really is a garbage suggestion AI/engine!And it has now gotten this printer 1-star!And a probable RETURN.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BY853E5HQ018?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,

R24KUMOKHUHK2W,"May 25, 2020",Justin Healy,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Waste of money,Hour 4 of trying to connect to WiFi. I would connect to computer but does not come with printer cable. Does come with cd but don't remember last computer I had that took a cd. Website pics do not match mobile app options. One has been updated but not the other.

R1UJU9DD7I2C54,"May 21, 2020",Jillian Olivar,5,C3224dw,Unverified,Printer setup is so straight forward and print quality is great as well,"I was nervous getting this printer due to other reviews of it being extremely difficult to set up to WiFi, I even purchased a direct chord for it just in case. But it was extremely straight forward. I recommend scanning the support QR code provided on the sheet of safety hazards and then watch the videos for setting up the printer and wifi. Follow the video step by step and pause as you go. Also the printer does come with ink.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UJU9DD7I2C54?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,
R1YBOUUUC8L0V5,"May 19, 2020",Tessa Odowd,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Too hard to install and doesn't work with WiFi,"Do not buy this printer It is a nightmare to install. After 3 days of tech support, the printer did not work. They are sending a new one. But I still may return it anyway. Its total overkill, don't know how it works and it's too big and heavy with no install instructions. The people at the tech support are great, but the printer still doesnt work. Still trying to hook it up.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YBOUUUC8L0V5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,1,Yes,"Thank you for taking time to write a review. We are sorry to hear about your disappointment with the printer, it’s not the kind of experience we wanted you to feel. And thank you for noticing the added weight from steel we put into the device’s frame in-order to create a business class, robust product. "

Finding a color laser printer only is not as easy as you would think. Easy set up comes with Lan, Wifi, USB hook up. Very nice to hook up via lan yet still be able to print from wireless device such as phone. Print quality is probably better than the 4 starts I gave but I have not really tried.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QBGWKREWG4CD?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,2,0,No,
