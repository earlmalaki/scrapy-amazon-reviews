R308V8ELPTPG08,"July 30, 2020",James M. Mcguire,3,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Printer is working but it's a returned printer.,"While setting printer up I noticed a few things that were not right. The tabs that you are required to remove for each color and black printing were missing. Next, when I opened the paper tray, there was paper already in it. When I went through the setup, I found it had already been set up once before in May of this year (this is July). Clearly, I didn't get the NEW printer I had ordered. The WiFi setup was harder than any other printer I have used to date (I've set up 5 since WiFi was an option), but I finally got it working. Print quality is OK for B/W text but not dark and uniform when using large fonts. The user manual was missing but I downloaded it on a PDF. Oh yeah, there was no registration card for warranty purposes. We'll see how hard it will be to register it online.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R308V8ELPTPG08?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

The printer is very heavy2. it only has one paper tray, I have to manually confirm on the printer if I change tray size.

R3LQOVVEX25D52,"July 16, 2020",kmt22,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Not good,"I did not believe the one star reviews mixed 50/50 with five star reviews - I wish I had. I bought this to use with Android phones in my household. If this printer works well, it must only be for certain phone types. This review is for use with the LGV50 ThinQ and Samsung Note 8.- Documentation is inadequate or non-existent. It's enough to get cartridges installed and printer turned on. After that, virtually no online reference to this specific printer exists, whether it be detailed manuals, online forums discussing specific problems, mobile drivers, etc. The only ""support"" that is useful is this page of Amazon customer reviews.- Wireless setup is cumbersome but not impossible. I was able to connect to my home wifi and produce a Wi-Fi direct network using the front panel. Feels like texting did in the year 2003, tapping each character out. It's easy to set a static IP address if desired, but this made no improvement in my ability to connect.- Due to wireless connectivity issues, I purchased a USB-B to USB-C cable. That's right, this does not support multi use USB and requires the ancient square USB type which I specially ordered on Amazon. No USB cables were supplied with my printer.- The Lexmark app from the Google play store specifically does not support this model of printer. I was able to load my doc but in the end, no connection to the printer. That leaves third party apps only.- Printers could be set up and available in my printer apps, but when selected, the printer is always ""unavailable right now."" Even when the printer happened to recognize a connection which I accepted on its front panel, the app would return ""internal printer error."" It takes over an hour of cycling apps and connection types to finally get a connection. I have had intermediate success with Samsung Print Service (even on my LG phone) and NoKo Print (over USB only). I have never been able to print from Lexmark Print or Mopria (supposed to be the universal standard of mobile print drivers with a consortium of manufacturers).- Note that print is only possible for photos and pdfs. Do not expect to print a webpage or other content without making a pdf first, unless specifically supported by the app.- The buffer is small. It will print one page, pause, print the next, pause. This takes up a lot of time for multi page documents.- Print quality is as expected from a cheap laser printer. Relatively crisp depending on the document. Occasionally get a thin red stripe down one side of the page. Pictures are ok, not great.- The thing weighs 50 pounds. How can I return that?? Get a strong desk or stand.In the end, this printer will let you down. If you are unlucky enough that your device doesn't play nicely, there is no remedy. I spend around an hour fighting with the printer each time I need something, usually an important form or tax document. Sometimes I just give up. And it doesn't even have a scanner, so it has no redeeming qualities. Save your money and go to a brick and mortar store to purchase a printer that is known to work with mobile devices. They cost more because they WORK. I am sorry I bought this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LQOVVEX25D52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,
