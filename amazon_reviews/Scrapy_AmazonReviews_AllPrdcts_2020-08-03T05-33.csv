R308V8ELPTPG08,"July 30, 2020",James M. Mcguire,3,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Printer is working but it's a returned printer.,"While setting printer up I noticed a few things that were not right. The tabs that you are required to remove for each color and black printing were missing. Next, when I opened the paper tray, there was paper already in it. When I went through the setup, I found it had already been set up once before in May of this year (this is July). Clearly, I didn't get the NEW printer I had ordered. The WiFi setup was harder than any other printer I have used to date (I've set up 5 since WiFi was an option), but I finally got it working. Print quality is OK for B/W text but not dark and uniform when using large fonts. The user manual was missing but I downloaded it on a PDF. Oh yeah, there was no registration card for warranty purposes. We'll see how hard it will be to register it online.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R308V8ELPTPG08?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R3LQOVVEX25D52,"July 16, 2020",kmt22,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Not good,"I did not believe the one star reviews mixed 50/50 with five star reviews - I wish I had. I bought this to use with Android phones in my household. If this printer works well, it must only be for certain phone types. This review is for use with the LGV50 ThinQ and Samsung Note 8.- Documentation is inadequate or non-existent. It's enough to get cartridges installed and printer turned on. After that, virtually no online reference to this specific printer exists, whether it be detailed manuals, online forums discussing specific problems, mobile drivers, etc. The only ""support"" that is useful is this page of Amazon customer reviews.- Wireless setup is cumbersome but not impossible. I was able to connect to my home wifi and produce a Wi-Fi direct network using the front panel. Feels like texting did in the year 2003, tapping each character out. It's easy to set a static IP address if desired, but this made no improvement in my ability to connect.- Due to wireless connectivity issues, I purchased a USB-B to USB-C cable. That's right, this does not support multi use USB and requires the ancient square USB type which I specially ordered on Amazon. No USB cables were supplied with my printer.- The Lexmark app from the Google play store specifically does not support this model of printer. I was able to load my doc but in the end, no connection to the printer. That leaves third party apps only.- Printers could be set up and available in my printer apps, but when selected, the printer is always ""unavailable right now."" Even when the printer happened to recognize a connection which I accepted on its front panel, the app would return ""internal printer error."" It takes over an hour of cycling apps and connection types to finally get a connection. I have had intermediate success with Samsung Print Service (even on my LG phone) and NoKo Print (over USB only). I have never been able to print from Lexmark Print or Mopria (supposed to be the universal standard of mobile print drivers with a consortium of manufacturers).- Note that print is only possible for photos and pdfs. Do not expect to print a webpage or other content without making a pdf first, unless specifically supported by the app.- The buffer is small. It will print one page, pause, print the next, pause. This takes up a lot of time for multi page documents.- Print quality is as expected from a cheap laser printer. Relatively crisp depending on the document. Occasionally get a thin red stripe down one side of the page. Pictures are ok, not great.- The thing weighs 50 pounds. How can I return that?? Get a strong desk or stand.In the end, this printer will let you down. If you are unlucky enough that your device doesn't play nicely, there is no remedy. I spend around an hour fighting with the printer each time I need something, usually an important form or tax document. Sometimes I just give up. And it doesn't even have a scanner, so it has no redeeming qualities. Save your money and go to a brick and mortar store to purchase a printer that is known to work with mobile devices. They cost more because they WORK. I am sorry I bought this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LQOVVEX25D52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

The price was right and Lexmark does have a good reputation. While the quality of printing and copying is good the software interface is just awful. It's clear that the lexmark programmers are sloppy and just not in tune with reality. User instructions are poor, and even the online stuff is bad. The printer is constantly going into ""offline"" mode and there is no way to change that except to unplug the device. You can;t even power down and then up again to reset it. You actually have to disconnect the power cord. So dumb. The scanner/copier feeder is also poor in that it can only handle about 5 pages otherwise it gets jammed.Scanning is also another issue as you actually have to set up the email account on the printer to get it to work or use a USB stick. Also dumb.

R16KJZQTOTLVJC,"July 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,1,MC3326adwe,Verified Purchase,toner costs more than the printer,"I print a lot, and I knew that I would be changing out an ink cartridge every week at the rate I print. I wanted a color printer since I do print documents and articles with color prints and images. Instead of an inkjet I decided to buy this laser printer, anticipating it would be cheaper in the long run than inkjet. I was wrong. After the 2nd week of having it I ran out of black toner which the printer informed me was low. I ordered the toner ($90 by the way), you have to order it since it is not sold in stores, (tried staples, best buy, office max, walmart, target, costco, etc). After the toner arrived I installed it and tried to print but it would not print since now the color toners were out. It did not mention that. I thought ok, I will only print in black and white or grayscale until I can get the color toner replaced. NOPE it will not print if any toner is out. I look up the color toner to purchase and it cost $100 MORE than the printer cost!!! I should have looked at that before buying the printer but I did not expect it to be so expensive. It is now a VERY expensive paperweight, as I refuse to pay more for my toner than for my printer. I ended up buying an inkjet, and although I will probably spend more money in the long run, I live paycheck to paycheck, I can purchase a $30 ink cartridge here and there, I can not drop $350 all at one time for toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KJZQTOTLVJC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,3,0,No,

R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ,"July 20, 2020",So disappointed,5,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,Amended review,"I purchased this printer after a great deal of long research. I broke my beloved canon and had been wanting to buy a color laser for over a year, and I purchased it after reviews from Amazon. I was aware the toner would not last very long, the estimate ranged from 200-300 pages, but the yellow toner ran out after only a few pages, and the printer would not print except in black without two yellow streaks down the side of the page. Prior to that, the print quality was fantastic -- it was super easy to set up - my computer did all the work -- it is connected to my printer via a cord, so I'm not doing any wireless printing -- I'm old, and I print mainly from digitals stored in my computer, so wireless is not a necessity for me -- Even though the printer was advertised as ""new"" I was concerned it had been returned -- I contacted Amazon via chat, and the young man that resolved my issue could not have been more helpful -- I could not find any generic or after-market cartridges such as ones available for canon and HP. I finally found replacement Lexmark cartridges from a company called quill.com -- at the most reasonable price I could find -- it was still $80, but it's supposed to last for roughly 600 pages -- this is the recycling program, which I like -- you could buy a cartridge with longer life for about $20 more -- also, I watched videos on youtube about replacing the toner powder at home and then resetting the printer chip -- you can buy toner for about $13 -- that may be an avenue I experiment with -- but as far as ease of use and print quality, I love it very much -- I make journals and one of the downfalls is, if you get a drop of water on an inkjet image, the whole page is ruined because it will smear -- I've had mono laser printers since the 1990's, so I knew if you act quickly, it could be saved -- when the printer arrived, I did a lot of water tests, and was very pleased with the results. Now that I know I can find cartridges at a reasonable cost, I'm much happier -- if you purchase from this seller, contact them prior to shipping -- shipping was delayed, and I still wonder if this was a returned printer -- so get sales person's name and write down exactly what they tell you. I hope this helps with your research.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,0,No,
R1CLTKNQSPQYOF,"July 19, 2020",Donald V. Rutkowski Jr.,1,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,The scanner functional is not efficient.,"The printer was easy to setup and I was printing paper within minutes. Now the scanner part, is a whole different story. After spending about 4 to 5 hours trouble shooting the scanner issue, I finally figured out how to scan from the printer to the computer and its not efficient at all.First you have to download the ""Lexmark Scanback Utility"", which is not part of the original driver package. Once you install and start running the utility, you will create a scanner profile. Second, you have to go back to the printer, load the paper you want to scan, then select the scanner profile you created. Once that is all done, you have successfully scanned your document. The big issue about this is, you have to run this process each time you want to scan a document. Your scanner profile is not saved to printer. Each time, you have to start the profile, load the paper then select the profile. After spending all this time on this new printer, I actually figured out how to get my older printer working better than this one.I am looking to return this somehow.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CLTKNQSPQYOF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review.

R30TVCKU4YYDM2,"June 24, 2020",Kevin Harrington,2,MC3426adw,Verified Purchase,Right Out Of The Box,"Set up for this printer is relatively easy *if* you have some knowledge of networking via ethernet and/or WiFi. It's not too difficult. The printer arrived where the carton appeared to be in excellent condition. The unit is well padded, and plenty of security tape to keep doors, trays and lids in place during shipping. Getting the printer up and running was easy for both the Mac and PC systems. The catch with this printer is the paper tray. The tray isn't the best solution in the printer industry. Considering the printer is 50 lbs. in weight, I'd assume the paper tray would have been constructed with metal guides and a solid tray solution. Not the case, it is all plastic. The tray and the printer paper *pick up function* didn't work well right out of the box. Of several 10's of sheets of different paper, none of the paper used would be successfully drawn from the tray to be printed. The printer *pick up function* from the tray was inadequate, with only one sheet out of 20+ attempts to print with this printer.Paper used: HP Premium 20 lb. paper HP Premium 24 lb. paper HP Premium 32 lb. paper HP Mulitpurpose 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Paper 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Plus 20 lb. paperThe tray filled with each of the different paper types, filed at full capacity, half capacity, near empty capacity... the results were the same. Every type of paper would begin its journey as the *pick up mechanism* would extract about 2 inches of the top sheet, then slice two one inch tears into the edge of the paper. The printer would report the *tray out of paper.* Clearly there's something wrong with this printer, at least the one received. The remedy to clear the ""out of paper"" error was to remove the tray, remove the damaged top sheet, then install the tray, and do the same thing over, and over, and over again.The price for a scanner, printer, fax, copier machine is reasonable, but if it doesn't work, it's a waste of time.The other Lexmark printer owned for several months/years is the model C2535.

This compact color MFP can fit almost anywhere. (13. 6 x 16. 2 x 15. 5 inches / 344. 4 x 411. 2 x 394. 1 mm), according to its makers. It is also, according to its makers, easy to use: its makers claim that it is plug it in and ready to go. Furthermore, they add that its standard wi-fi makes it easy to print from mobile devices.That it is interconnective: its 2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information. That it will enable the user to scan to network, email, FTP, or USB stick drive, scan to, print files from popular cloud services with Lexmark's Cloud Connector, while providing security. That its extra high yield unison toner will provide up to 4, 500 pages of output, so the user can print more, stop less. And it is durable, as its steel frame, long-life imaging components mean it’s built to last. So the user can get solid performance, get things done with a 1-GHz dual-core processor, output up to 26 ppm. The manufacturers also state that the printer, with its Unison Toner, will deliver rich, vibrant color with crisp details, for outstanding quality. The manufacturers also claim that this printer will deliver media flexibility, enabling the user to get universal media handing from A6 to legal; support for specialty media like envelopes, optional input expandable up to 751 pages.

Then, setting it up is anything but easy: the makers offer a coupla pages of weird diagrams, no written instructions, and a CD. Whose computer has CD portals anymore? Then, it doesn’t print pictures, to those of you who might want to. And it needs lithium batteries which are difficult to fit, pricey. But my main problem with it was my difficulty in figuring out the scan function, which is not even listed on its index of available functions. ( And, by the way, its touch screen is tiny.) And figuring out how to scan was difficult even with the help of my professional computer guru. In my life, I must have the ability to scan, as, even though this printer, like my previous model, offers the ability to fax, the wiring in my place doesn’t allow this function. So I must scan and email important documents. Gotta scan.

R8Z4KZYQ63GSK,"May 26, 2020",S. Brown,2,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,no documentation and heavier than most printer stands can take,"I was excited to be offered to test and review this printer. Most of the places I’ve worked at have had Lexmark printers as they are such workhorses. But I haven’t personally owned one and so never had to try to set one up before.First thing you need to know is that this printer is HEAVY. It comes in at 50 pounds. And until I got this, I had no idea that almost all printer stands will only support a printer of 30 pounds. It took me awhile to find a stand that would be big enough (it also has a larger footprint than my previous printers) and sturdy enough and rated to handle the weight of this. After I found one and ordered it, I was contacted by the seller, in very broken English, asking me to please cancel the order because they really didn’t have any stands! After many more hours of searching, I gave up on printer stands and found instead a “roll cart with drawers” (no longer available) that was big enough and rated to hold the weight. After it finally arrived, I then had to assemble it and wait for the glue to dry before I could use it.So now the printer is on the stand and I am ready to set it up. Not. There are no directions or manual or any real info with this. All it came with are several pages of pictures showing you how to remove all the tape and packing material in, on and around the printer. The only other thing they show is putting the CD into your computer. I tried that. It did NOTHING. The CD does not have a manual or info or anything like that on it. Instead it appears to be a program that will auto install the drivers and optionally some utilities. However, you have to first have the printer on your wifi.There are NO directions or information on how to connect to your wifi. On all of my previous wifi printers, they came with detailed, step by step directions that were easy to follow. This printer leaves you to figure it out yourself. First issue is the password.The touch screen “buttons” you need to press to enter your password as so tiny that I found it impossible to know if I pressed the right one. This is due to the fact that the screen does not show you what you pressed! Not even momentarily. Nope, it gives you nothing but asterisk. Maybe if I had a short password, it would be ok, but ours is very long and a mix of letters and numbers. I tried repeatedly, but it would not work for me. After a few more days I found an old rubber tipped stylus and that helped. They next problem was with our router (I didn’t have anything to do with the purchase of this or it’s setup – it is NOT one I would have chose).I finally seemed to have gotten the right combination of “buttons” on the printer and the router pushed and with the stylus, the right characters for the password input and it connected to wifi. Running the CD was easy and I did install one of the optional programs.You would think all is fine finally and I would be able to use the printer. And you would be wrong. I thought I would start by scanning in some art that I recently finished. On almost every printer I’ve worked with before, there would be a “button” for “print”, “fax”, “copy”, and “scan”. Nothing so simple on this one. The only “scan” option says “scan profiles”. Since there are no instructions for anything, I push that. Big mistake evidently. The printer locked up. It was completely non-responsive.After 30 minutes, I gave up and pulled the plug. That seemed to reset it from the beginning when I first turned it on. It did however, remember the network and connect itself without my intervention. It takes several minutes to get itself ready. Now I no longer have the “scan properties” option.So this time I decided to try printing from the cloud. I signed into One Drive through Word and saved this document. Went to the printer and selected One Drive. It makes me give it a name for some weird reason then tells me I have to go to a website and read pages of legalese and agree then input a code. I did all of that and found myself at a sign in to One Drive. Weird. I just signed in. So I sign in here and see nothing for me to do and can not find the cloud storage from here. It just got me to my account info with Microsoft.I go back to the printer, figuring I did what it said so I was good to go. NOT. The printer is showing me the code again and telling me I have to go agree and input the code on the website. Round and round we go. I again hit ok. BTW, before you can type that URL in and connect, the printer will flip screens so you have to again click several times to get back to the code so you can type it in. I again agree, and again am set to sign in with Microsoft. This time, MS asks if I want to let my printer have access to my cloud. Amongst the things I expected, for some reason Lexmark also is saying it has to have full access to my profile. Not sure why it would need that to print but I don’t save much to the cloud so I don’t really need to be concerned – I hope.So, I grant access and end up back at Lexmark which now has a message that I am ALMOST done. That now that it is set up, I HAVE to print from the cloud within 72 hours or it will delete all of this info and I have to start all over again. Fine. Whatever. I select the cloud and the named profile and find my directory tree as in OneDrive. Choose something to print and not sure what to do next. I take a chance and press the arrow and it prints. So that at least seems to work as advertised after you jump through the hoops.Print quality was excellent and the photos and illustrations came out fantastic. There was no banding in the gradients and the colors were good. Very pleased with this part of the printer.I can’t find any options to scan except scan to cloud. That is extremely disappointing. I don’t see why there isn’t a scan to computer option like all my other printers have had. That makes an extra step for me. Scan to cloud, go to cloud to retrieve. Why? That is just dumb. I guess they figure you only use this for business and not for ever using with photos or graphics that need repair or retouch/rework in a program on your computer.So my low rating is mainly due to the lack of documentation. I have lots of options when I click on things but no idea what they mean or do. I don’t really have the time to sit and hit all the buttons to see what happens. I have things I need it to do and simply want to know how to do them. I shouldn’t have to first figure it out on my own.-------------It is now August 2020 and I have been online and found the documentation. While it is helpful, the printer still requires you to jump through a ton of hoops to do everything except a straight print from computer.I use my printers to scan in documents and this is NOT easy on this printer. It can be done but with many many unneeded steps in comparison to EVERY single printer I have ever owned.You have to open the scan utility. I had to download that software and install first. Then you have to pick what size document you want to scan. Fine. You would think that would be it. That the printer would be smart enough for you to select this ONCE and done. Then if you needed to make a change, you would go back and change it. NO doesn't work like that.You have to give it a profile name. That name is then sent to the printer under the very unintuitive menu item of ""shortcuts"". Then you click on shortcuts and then your name and then it will do it. However it will always use the same path name and same file name for every time. NOT useful.To make it work, I set up two different profile ""shortcuts"" (interesting that they don't both appear on the printer - only the one at a time). Then I make a desktop shortcut. One is for legal sized and one is for letter. It will not print any larger than letter, but it will scan larger.So I pick either the letter or the legal desktop shortcut I made. It gives me a dialog box on the computer that I MUST answer NO to in order for this to work. if I answer yes, the scans will always over write each other. only THEN can I go over to the printer, wake it up by pushing the arrow ""button"", wait until it gives me the screen and find ""shortcuts"" then the name of the ""profile"". I forget what it is called, but I think it is just scan. I can't get it confused because I only ever see the one associated with the desktop shortcut!Then I put the item on the glass and push the arrow button again and it scans.what a huge PITA. I have never had to jump through so many hoops to do almost everything with a printer. It insists that you create profiles and each one has to have a name before it will do anything. But every time I look, there are no profiles listed in the menu. Very odd. You have to jump through this naming garbage to use the cloud print or scan also.I guess you could say I love/hate this thing. It works well, just it is a royal pain to use.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8Z4KZYQ63GSK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,2,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review and we are sorry to hear about the challenges you faced with setting up this printer.

This Lexmark is a step up from the quality that I’m used to from them. The construction doesn’t feel as cheap or shoddy, and it actually feels like a fairly solid printer. I like that they’re upping the quality for home laser printing. I much prefer laser quality over ink, and they have not disappointed in that regard. The toner replacement seems a little steep, but if you’re getting 4500 pages as opposed to 500, it can average out.That being said, the touch screen is a little too small for my fingers, and makes it difficult to use. The setup is pretty straight forward and easy with no real surprises if you have any kind of familiarity with printer set up.

R2T03U91SZ94NP,"May 19, 2020",Jon R,1,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, hampered by terrible software","The short version: Don’t bother with this, while the hardware is good it’s paired with terrible software that ruins the experience. You can get much better for the same price, in fact it’s actually on the upper end of what I’d consider reasonable pricing. You can probably get the same or better for even less if you look for sales.Longer version:As I said the printer hardware is nice. It’s not too big for a color laser, prints clearly on every paper type, is fairly quiet, and fast. I’d give the hardware a 4/5 if Lexmark could hire someone who knew anything about software to fix the garbage software this thing runs.Now first let me side track a bit because this needs mentioning. The instructions that come with this are ridiculous. You get a about 7 pages of paper with no words, just photos (poor ones at that) and a CD. Honestly, who still has a CD drive on their computer? If they want to throw one in, fine, but they also need a thumb drive or just tell you where to go to download manuals and let you know to do it online. The good news is those do exist, but you have to go to Lexmark’s website and find it yourself. I work in IT, so I knew how to setup a printer, but not everyone does. Those pictures (I’m not even going to call them instructions) are not going to help anyone.Now with that out of the way back to my reason for rating this printer low despite the nice hardware. The crap software. So the first thing I ran into was the printer suggested using an app to set it up faster. That’s cool, other printer have done that and it can be easier then trying to set it up on those small screens. Except this app just doesn’t work. For one thing it’s about as bare bones as you can get, and looks like it hasn’t been updated in years (and the update notes suggest it hasn’t, they only added support for newer printers). It couldn’t find the printer, which is expect during setup but it gave no instruction on how to connect to the printer. I finally got it to see the printer by using my phone’s WiFi direct. Except the app, either due to poor design or a bug, did not do any setup it went right to the main screen, and once again complained about not finding the printer. I gave up on that and decided to do it on the printer itself. I don’t think even the most petite persons fingers could type on that keypad. It took several tries to get the passwords to match because you can't see what you are typing, so I kept making typos. Next up was WiFi. Connecting to the network took a few tries, again, because there are not clear instructions included nor onscreen instructions. Once I was connected, it worked but again I am in IT and know about these things. Someone not in IT probably would have a harder time. Now begins another annoying adventure - I get through the needlessly annoying setup and arrive at the main screen. Several things have a lock beside them so I try to enter my password from earlier to unlock them, and it doesn’t work. I guess I might have typed it wrong since the keypad is so hard to use. So I go into settings and find the option to do a factory reset, nothing happens when I tap it. After some frustration I realize you have to restart the printer for the reset to happen – why wouldn’t it tell me that? Ok annoying setup again, this time I say screw the password and just make it 12345, it’s not like anyone else has access to this. Ok good news is that the password works now. Now the thing has the wrong region? What? It doesn’t let me change it either. I tried ANOTHER reset and during setup the region was STILL locked to the wrong location. After much frustration I found it can be changed via the web interface. FINALLY the printer is ready to use.First thing I try is via my phone since I have it with me. I try their app, because the app for my HP printer had been handy. Lexmark’s app is as useless as that setup app, bare bones, and outdated. I just decided to use Android’s printing and that worked. Next up my iPad. Since this is an Airport printer I decided to use that. Well, Airport was a no-go, it could never connect. I tried their iOS app and it was no better then their Android one. So basically it’s a no-go for iOS printing. And final my Windows PC. Their Windows software is trash like the rest. Windows couldn’t find the printer without Lexmark’s crap software. But I used the old manual printer setup to manually enter the IP and it was able to connect and print.See the pattern here? Lexmark should hire some high school kid to go and recode all their software, because it’s obvious nobody there knows how to do it. When you factor in the headaches this terrible software will give you, this printer is not worth the price.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T03U91SZ94NP?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,1,2,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review.

RGQVHD00RV4Y1,"July 15, 2020",Nathan,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,rapid print and high resolution,"We have been VERY pleased with this printer for our home office. Install only took minutes with finding an appropriate place for it (printer is hefty and a large size) and plugging it into power. Connection to our desktop took just a few minutes and that was able to be completed wirelessly. My wife and I also have the app connected to our phones so printing from mobile devices is easy as a few clicks. We have been through about a ream (500 pages) of paper or so and no jams. Granted we have only been using the tray and not the manual feed. Printing speed is mind-blowing, actually takes longer for the printer to process the print job and spool up than for the paper to come out. What is also very impressing is the picture printing quality when using photo paper. Overall, a great home office printer if you need something heavy duty and not have to worry about the ink drying out from time between uses like a standard inkjet.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGQVHD00RV4Y1?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,0,0,No,

R2LG9CZCCKIY1W,"June 21, 2020",Matt P.,4,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Excellent, Fast Printing In A Heavy Plastic Housing","Lexmark is known to make some excellent printers, both large and small, for business and home use. This model could be used easily for a home office, and for a small business that needs high quality prints. Set up on this is easy and straightforward, and can be used with WiFi or Ethernet. App is available for WiFi set up. i was very disappointed in the touch screen, where all your settings and options are found. This Lexmark sells for $259.00 (as of this review), and for that money, if it's gonna have a touch screen, it should be at least big enough to see the text, and definitely big enough for your fingers to be able to use it. The description states ""2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information"". I hardly believe it to be ""convenient interaction"" at all, when I had to enter my password for WiFi, literally, I had to do it like 5 times. I know my password, but the keyboard is so small, even my smaller fingers had a tough time landing on the touch key correctly, and hitting the right letter or number. There's plenty of real estate on here that another inch would not have interfered with anything, and made a world of difference. The price of screens like this has pretty much dropped to rock bottom, they are so widely produced, so don't understand. I have a $69 Canon that has a touch screen at least 50% bigger, and much easier to use than this.As others have stated, the paper tray is a little flimsy, not falling apart flimsy, but not as exact as I thought it would be. The entire housing looks like it's made of plastic (it states it has a metal frame), and although that in itself is not bad, it's just some parts, like the tray, could have used a little more support, and sliding in and out, it could have used a sturdier slide than what it has. If I had bought a printer for under $100 bucks (which there are more than enough of those to choose from, and getting better quality every day), this is what I would expect. As far as the main feature, and what this is built for, printing, it's excellent. Prints are sharp, even the smallest print. Pictures are color perfect, even at 8x11, they look great. All print out quickly, and to me, quietly. I know some have stated this is a loud printer. The only times I notice it is loud was the initial setup, and if it's been totally shut down. I leave mine on standby, and pretty much just makes a kind of fan running sound when it's printing, quiet to me, and then goes back to sleep until I wake it again. FYI: This is a printer only. I think a lot of people (like my wife too, was wondering where you lift up to scan and make a copy, it doesn't, this is a one trick pony, but it's excellent at it. If you are looking for a high quality printer function only, for professional looking work, this can do the job. It's also expandable to a second tray if you need to do a lot of printing. Toner is not cheap, depending on where you shop I guess. Average price I found, for the black cartridge only, was about $100 bucks, at a very well known national office supply company. But, printer toner is known to vary wildly in price, and tomorrow it could be $19.99, who knows. Overall, an excellent printer, in a good looking, VERY heavy, plastic housing. If you don't care about anything else about this printer, except that you want perfect, professional looking print, at a reasonably priced small office printer, this is your man (printer). Lexmark makes great printers, this is one of them, and my only major gripe was the screen, and the paper tray a minor gripe. Other than that, even my other printer I had for a few years because it always performed so well (from a very well known company that also makes good printers, and sold for around the same price as this), didn't print as well as this when it came to precision print. For the price, I'm impressed with the print, and worth the asking price (especially if they decide to do something with that screen!)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LG9CZCCKIY1W?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,

This wasn’t the case with this wireless laser printer. First, let me say that I actually much prefer toner over ink cartridge printer. I think the quality is much better. In that, the Lexmark didn’t disappoint. The quality of the color printing was crisp and clean, just as I would hope for.It was an easy set up process, and I was able to get it going in very short time. It is on the heavy side, but when you stop to consider that it has 4 separate cartridges, one for each of the CMYK, that can be expected. It is also loud when winding up and printing, although it sits quietly once it is all settled until, until you print. Again, not unexpected for laser printer.It does print pretty quickly, which is a bonus, but I feel that it is not all together as sturdily made as I would like. I feel sometimes that I have to be extra careful not to break some of the flimsier pieces, which sadly are ones that would have to be moved more often for replacing toner, etc.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38NG82GBK4NTD?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,
R24L4T9DX86HG4,"May 14, 2020",Billz,3,C3426dw,Vine Customer,Great quality with difficult Mac WiFi connection,"The quality of the printed documents in color is superb ... even on inexpensive printer paper (see picture). Once connected, the Lexmark C3426dw Color Laser Printer is easy to use, adjust and do everything I want with a printer. However, in attempting to make a wireless connection, I was stymied at every turn. I use a Macintosh computer — an iMac with a MacOS 10.15.4 Catalina operating system. It's the latest, but it's not a brand new OS—been around for a year...maybe a little less. When I began setting up the printer for a wireless connection, I followed the steps, but at some point in the process, I was told that I needed new firmware to continue. I downloaded the Lexmark Virtual Solution Center Plugin to update the firmware and went to open the .dmg file with the app, and was told by my computer that it could not be opened because ""Apple cannot check it for malicious software"" and directed me to contact the app-maker. At that point I was ready to give up, but I had a cable that I could physically connect to my iMac via the USB port to a port on the Lexmark. I did so, and presto! Everything worked fine; except for the fact that I cannot use it with WiFi. In the past, my wife and I shared a printer using WiFi, but not with this new Lexmark even though past Lexmarks we've owned worked fine with WiFi connections. Lest one groan ... ""...it's a Mac..."" consider that the computers filling art and graphic departments are likely to be Macs—that's where a color printer is most likely to be used.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24L4T9DX86HG4?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for taking time to write a review.

RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",V-TEAM,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,3,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively. Just be prepared to work though some issues with the initial setup.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EARTFHZLR1C9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,

I chose to connect via cord, but you have wireless options present.Printing speed, for me, hits 41 PPM. When I do speed print with this, every page is consistent in quality. No issues, of note.Sound wise, this isn't exactly a quiet printer, but it's not obnoxious, either.Overall footprint is quite small; this can easily be hidden if you so choose.Overall build quality and parts are very high. As I mentioned above, Lexmark makes great stuff and this printer is no different.In sum, this is a great option for the home or small business.

It takes only a few seconds to print each page and I love that it prints double sided super easily. It is also extremely easy to print from a smartphone, which has saved me because I cannot for the life of me figure out how to install/download the needed software on my laptop. Without a CD/DVD port in your laptop, set up is extremely unclear and difficult... I still haven't figured it out! Also-- the toner it cartridge the laptop came with was running on ""low"" after only 1 week using the printer. I figured since it is just a starter cartridge that makes sense, but I had no idea how difficult it was going to be to find a replacement. They aren't sold on amazon that I could find (or anywhere else for that matter). I think I ordered the correct thing on the Lexmark website, but it cost me over $120. I personally can't afford a replacement cartridge every month at that price. On top of that, the website reads that there are only ""5 items left in stock,"" which I assume is now 4 that I just ordered one.

RH9GU757CDJQ9,"June 28, 2020",Jimster480,4,B3340dw,Vine Customer,A fast printer with an easy setup but a weird amount of network usage,"I setup this printer to replace my 6 year old $50 laser that has been chugging along faithfully. I've tested out a few other printers in the last months but this one is my favorite so far.The Good:- Has double sided printing (has to be a 2 page + document though)- Very fast printing (wake up to print time is around 14 seconds, only around 4 seconds if its on ""sleep"") and definitely hits its 40ppm claim. I did print out over 20 sheets for my son (single sided) in one clip and it was done in under 1 minute (including warm up time from ""sleep).- The printer Has Ethernet and a screen where everything can be setup without a PC even if it takes a little while on the 2 line screen. I was able to plug it into my network and get it working via the printer only in about 5 minutes.- Print Quality is very good; much better than my old $50 laser which is impressive considering how fast it spits the pages out!- Large Paper Tray; Holds 250 sheets and actually has a meter that tells you how much paper there is (in 3 different tiers of full, Nearly Full, OK) in the printer. Paper tray can be adjusted to various different types of paper so cards and other smaller formats can be printed.- Has a 50 sheet bypass tray in the back for separate paper types.- Drivers make it easy to setup duplexing and paper sizes.- Allows for PIN based print and hold features for offices; so users can print confidential documents that they will need to enter a pin to physically print out (printer will hold the print job in memory until it is retrieved).- Supports PCL5e; great for workgroups and other network printing scenarios.- Supports Wifi-Direct; this allows for direct printing from laptops or mobile devices without needing to be on the local network. You can enable to disable this in the options menu.- Supports Google Cloud Print: It can be toggled with a single button in the operator menu.- Super easy website user interface; Every area has easy drop down options and even firmware can be easily updated with a couple clicks via this page (printer local IP address). Check the included image to see what the page looks like.- Supports 500+ page paper trays or multiple paper trays. There is a whole family of printers from Lexmark that share paper trays; giving you many options to expand your paper capacity if need be.Cons- Has a coil whine that repeats 2x/second when its on ""sleep"" mode; must put printer into hibernate (which takes between 30-40 seconds to wake up) to make this go away.- Default windows driver install on a ""detected"" printer only contains the MAC address and not the name of the printer. Also has weird printing limitations and doesn't work properly. Drivers from the website are required to fix this.- 2 Line screen has poor viewing angles requiring you to be over the top of the printer to view it.- Rear Bypass tray requires Printer to not be near a wall. You need a full foot + behind the printer to be able to use it. Making it pretty useless in most applications since the power, ethernet, USB connections are around the bypass tray.- Uses a bunch of data on the network; I logged over 300MB in a day of data transfer without any printing. This seems to happen even when its on hibernate. My other printers use less than 1MB a day of data. I am not sure why this printer keeps sending 200kb every minute or so.Conclusion:I think I will be keeping this one to use it for my kids. Toner prices are decent with 3000 page toner cartridges available for under $90 (at the time of writing) and 1500 page ones available under $60.Considering the price of toner for some other printers on the market; this is both affordable and competitive.Overall this is a great printer for the money; it is very fast, prints with great quality and has a smaller form factor. Unlike other printers I have tested; this one I can actually recommend. It seems to also go on sale pretty frequently; meaning that you might be able to pick it up at an even better deal than the regular price.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful!

Come to find out, Lexmark's software has some kind of ""problem"" with COMCAST (and one other ISP whose name I can't recall) as an internet service provider. You have to CALL Lexmark and talk to a technician to get the software patch. I found this out on a Friday night at 6 p.m. Lexmark does not provide tech support on evenings or weekends!!! So I was stuck until Monday, and I really NEEDED this printer. Monday morning I dutifully called Tech Support and talked to a gentleman whose accent was so heavy that I could not understand half of what he was telling me. When he heard that my ISP was Comcast, he agreed to email me a link to the software I needed and instructions for how to install it, which he did.We downloaded the software patch and installed it on my work computer, which is running Windows 10, 64 bit version. Still no connection. I then tried using a cable and it STILL didn't work. My IT guy was totally confused as to why this would be happening. He wanted me to bring the printer and my computer to his house so he could look at it. At that point, I knew it just wasn't going to work with this Lexmark printer - it weighs over 35 pounds, and I am almost 70. There was just no way that was going to happen, not with my bad back. I barely was able to get it up on the work table, much less haul it over to someone's house and back again. I have never run into a printer (or any peripheral) that had a ""problem"" with certain ISPs, to the point where these kind of measures had to be taken to install a workaround, which still didn't work in the end.I wish I could remember the name of the other internet service provider that was affected, besides Comcast, because this issue needs to be FULLY disclosed BEFORE someone purchases one of these printers and has the disappointing experience of not being able to connect it, with or without additional software to ""fix"" the problem. This sounds like a Lexmark problem, not a Comcast problem - it's not like Comcast is some small regional provider. I would urge the people over at Lexmark to 1) Fix this problem so that talking to Technical Support is not necessary to get the patch, and 2) fix the problem so that it doesn't occur to begin with!I will never again purchase another Lexmark product of any kind, due to this unnecessary and unsatisfactory experience.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JG9X6GFFLLAT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,2,0,No,

It's much easier to fine tune from there rather than through the buttons on the actual printer.We've owned many many printers over the years. Wireless printing is great!

Offers double sided printing (with reduced speeds) for all paper conscious.The print quality is on par with all other laser printers. Same goes with price of replacement cartridges.

That is their prerogative. However, inexplicably they push out firmware updates that often cause the printer to misidentify good OEM cartridges as non-OEM and render the printer unusable.The printer I purchased came with OEM cartridges. Worked fine for several months, then all of a sudden with an automatic firmware update (I DIDN'T INSTALL) the printer incorrectly flagged a cartridge as invalid. With that one cartridge flagged, the printer will not print at all. My printer has been offline for a month working out a ""bad' cartridge with customer support. Completely ridiculous. If I could return this I would, but too late for returns unfortunately. Very unhappy with this purchase.Update: Horrible Customer Support - after several weeks of back and forth with support, providing them with all sorts of personal information, they told me this was my problem.

I had to pay people to lift this monster into a position where it would replace another old printer. Out of the box, nothing but problems. No cables, no manual, no instructions. A sheet of paper with some cartoons on it about remove this and do that. To get anything at all, it had to be found on the internet and a PDF file downloaded with detailed instructions. But, the instructions are confusing and not accurate. After calling the phone support and getting told conflicting things, we got it to print. But first all toner cartridges had to be removed and shaken because the toner had sat too long. Then we had to hire a computer expert to help us connect it. It had to be directly connected to the computer as the wifi did not work. So, after all that, it printed in color. I printed maybe a couple weeks, but then the color deteriorated and then the toner ran out. So, the toner cartridges are quite expensive. Now, if it had been a user-friendly machine and had come with up-to-date instructions, we may have kept using it. That was not the case. If the toner had lasted longer and it was not a toner guzzler, we may have kept using it. That was not the case. If we had been able to get it to scan into email, we may have had use for it. It does not scan or copy or fax. It only prints, and not as well as it should, and it's full of bugs. Again, this machine needs a redesign from the bottom up. Nothing but a big HEADACHE.

R29B5MVB0OH7IE,"January 16, 2020",Namsag,2,MC2425adw,Verified Purchase,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased this product because of the reliability of the Lexmark, the price point seemed a good value, the quality of the printed product it produces is great, and number one was the features. An all in one printer, fax, copy, and scan. It worked beautifully after a somewhat complicated set-up. Worked great for about a week and then it happened. The scan feature disappeared from the menu screen. Did you get that? THE SCAN FEATURE DISAPPEARED FROM THE MENU! A few on and off cycles did not return it to the menu screen. It was not in the set-up options either. It just evaporated into thin air. So I unplugged the unit for a few minutes and that did not restore the feature either. I tried that several times with different combinations of off on unplug, on unplug, and etc. Nothing worked. I gave up. went to a service store, got the document on one of my flash drives and made it happen that way. On another note, this device goes through several operations a day on its own. Don't know what its doing but it does it without fail. It is left on to receive faxes. It does this at all hours of the day and night! So, totally frustrated, I called Lexmark support. Now the real frustration sets in. Tech support is NOT in america. Don't know where it is but English is not their first or second language. I was on the phone for about two hours trying my very best to communicate this issue. After giving them the model number several times, and the serial number, tech support kept referring to a different model. I finally got it across to them the model I had and that solved nothing. I followed everything they asked me to do and nothing changed, nothing fixed. And they continued to tell me to use the touch screen which this model does not have. Repeatedly, they told me to touch a button I did not have. I had to repeat myself several times with every piece of info I needed them to have. Absolutely the worst tech support I have EVER encountered. They solved nothing. Repeatedly apologizing, about every third sentence or so. This call was made about 4pm mountain time on a weekday. So, I tried again a few days later in the morning hoping to get someone familiar with the English language. Same results. Now a funny thing happens once in awhile. The scan feature will return all on its own from time to time for awhile. I was so excited to see it on the menu that I scanned something just to see if I was really awake or if this was a dream. It worked every time I saw it on the menu screen. That has now ended and it just won't appear on the menu any more. Of course I went on the net to search for a fix and this is a well known issue, this disappearance of the scan feature. On another note. I DID purchase a 3 year Asurion protection plan. Filed a claim, went thru the process to get some help. After several days I think it was, might have been longer, I got an email saying that a tech was going to be sent out to service my unit and that one would be calling to set up an appointment for service. No one called. after several weeks, I got another email stating that I needed to ship the unit to Asurion and that shipping materials were on the way and that I was to pack it up and send it in. The shipping materials arrived, a label. Just a label and a repair information form. The repair information form is for a video game console, not a printer or an electronic device, or anything else. A video game console. This printer is about 15 times bigger than a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE! maybe bigger than that. What happened to the service tech that was going to be sent out. I just want it fixed! I love it but I need the scan feature. So I looked up the newer and next step better unit on amazon and low and behold it was available and at just a bit more money. I had to read the reviews and guess what. It has the very same issue! Lots of complaints about the scan feature disappearing on that newer model as well. I'm tired of typing this. I made every effort to get this thing to work myself, tech support, a protection plan, and now faces with returning/shipping a very big box if I can even find one. I could take it to UPS and see if they would box it up for shipping. That would be on my dime I believe even if they would box up something this big and awkward. Guessing $30 to $40 to get that done if they would do it. All of you, save yourself a lot of grief and don't buy this Lexmark model MC2425 or any models near it. Make absolutely sure their are no complaints on this scan issue. You have been warned. I am going to try once again to get intouch with Lexmark and see if there is a fix for this issue. I have a feeling that I will never be able to speak with Lexmark, but some person that knows absolutely nothing about this issue or anything about a fix. I would accept a new unit without this issue if they would send one out and I would return this beater I have on the printer support rack.

My only struggle was when I tried to switch from plain paper to labels, the label paper is slick on the back side and the first two sheets I tried did not want to get picked up by the coil. So, I had to take out the labels and air the sheets. What I’ve noticed is that It really helps if you keep the tray full.

The longest part of it was loading the disk onto my computer so it could print wirelessly. I used the mobile app to get it started and then popped in the disk and I was ready to go. It's probably the easiest printer I've ever set up. I sent some color pages to the printer and it did a beautiful dual side printing where the colors on the paper look just like the original did from my screen. A simple basic laser color printer.

R39U02I9NMEL2E,"August 12, 2019",Benjamin H. George,4,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Doesn't have enough memory to print multi-page documents,"I took a chance and got this printer based on the positive Amazon Vine reviews. The set up was a breeze, even using just the control panel and not the app. However, I tried printing a 20-page PDF that has a file size of 5mb. The printer could not process the PDF and would only print a single page and give me an error saying that the memory is full. So then I tried to just print two pages from the PDF, and it can't even handle that. If it can't print a multi-page document it is pretty worthless. And there is no way you can print 24 pages a minute if you have to print them one page at a time. If you just want to print a single page all the time, than this printer would be great for you, and the print quality was good. But if you need to print a multi-page document... you'll want to look somewhere else. Needless to say, I will be returning this and buying another HP or Brother printer.Update #1 - I spent a whole day trying to get this printer to work. I reinstalled it multiple times, restored factory settings, reset it up, updated the printer firmware, updated my operating system, and then finally figured out that if I installed it using generic post script printing and boom! it works. There was zero support on the Lexmark website. So they lose a star for that.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39U02I9NMEL2E?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,104,2,Yes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your purchase of the Lexmark C3224 and taking the time to post a review.

R2D8D7FIKARD1S,"August 7, 2019",optimummind,4,C3224dw,Vine Customer,Good-value color laser printer with inconsistent wake-up printing time.,"=== My Take ===The Lexmark C3224dw is my first ever color laser printer and I like it very much for the most part. I like its compact and space-saving design and dimensions despite its heavier than expected heft. The control panel screen is bright & clear and the buttons around it are very responsive to my inputs. It is very intuitive to operate even without consulting the user manual first.I also liked its print quality - both in color and black & white. Text and images came out clear and smudge-free and the printing speed was satisfactory. Print operations were quiet, even the warm-up routine. Intermittently, however, the printer took an unusually long time to wake up from its Sleep & Hibernate status. There were times when we waited for longer than 30 seconds before the printer began flashing its light & started to print. Once it got warmed up, though, all later printer jobs printed at normal and satisfactory speeds.Another strong point for the C3224dw is its fast and simple setup process. I added it to my home network using just the control panel buttons to select my home WiFi and typing in the password. This process was seamless and very smooth. I also connected the printer to my desktop via a USB Type B cable (not included in the box) and installed the printer by installing the driver package from the Lexmark website. You also have the option to set it up using an Ethernet cable (also not included).Despite easily adding the printer to my home WiFi, however, none of my Windows 10 laptops around the house could find the printer during an actual print job, such as from Microsoft Word and Chrome browser. My wifey, who is not very techy, got frustrated because the printer wasn't listed in the printer selection drop-down menu. I had to go to Settings in Windows 10 and add the printer manually by typing in its IP address on each of my laptops. Compared to my other printers from Brother and HP, this part of my printing experience was subpar and disappointing. I expected a big printer company such as Lexmark to do a better job integrating the C3224dw to Windows 10.Another surprising thing was that there was no Windows 10 Lexmark app for the C3224dw printer. In order to access its settings, I had to launch the Embedded Web Server by opening a browser such as Chrome and then typing in its IP address. I guess some people might prefer this approach because it is one less app you have to install but I wouldn't have minded a Windows 10 app. You can install the Lexmark phone app but I chose not to do so because I have too many apps installed already on my Galaxy S10+ (>200).Once you access the printer settings via the Embedded Web Server, things are pretty straightforward and easy to navigate within. There are two main settings categories - Status & Settings. Under Status, you can view any Alerts & Warnings messages, Supply/Toner status, and printer info (firmware version, paper bin status).Under Settings, there are six additional sub-categories: Device, Print, Paper, Network/Ports, Security, and Reports.Under the Device section, I found the following options to be useful for our home - setting up low printer supply email notifications, configuring Sleep & Hibernate timeouts, turning on Eco Mode, and performing a firmware update.Inside the Print section, I turned on Duplex printing & the Collate option and set image printing to ""Auto Fit.""Inside the Network/Ports section, I left alone all the numerous options at their default (Wireless, AirPrint, Ethernet, TCP/IP, SNMP, IPSec, 802.1x, LPD, HTTP/FTP, USB, Restrict external network access, WiFi Direct) but did activate Google Cloud Print.I also left everything at default in the Security sub-section.Although the Settings page is plain and simple-looking, navigation among the options was quick, responsive, and very satisfactory and I appreciated all options given to me.All in all, I'm happy & satisfied with the Lexmark C3224dw and I don't regret getting it. Hopefully future firmware updates will improve printer wakeup time from its Sleep/Hibernate status._____*Pros:-Easy setup (WiFi or USB Type B).-Control panel buttons are responsive and intuitive to use.-Both color and black & white prints come out nice and clear.-Compact footprint.-Quiet operation.-Supports Lexmark Mobile Print, Google Cloud Print, Mopria Print, Apple AirPrint, and Wifi Direct.-Settings page offer numerous fine-tuning, network, and security options._____*Neutral:-Pretty heavy~!!-Wake-up time from Sleep is longer than I prefer.-Printer didn't get auto-detected by Windows 10 on all of my laptops on my home network. I had to add it manually by entering its IP address.-Performing a firmware update over the Embedded Web Server isn't as easy & simple as doing it with a Windows 10 or smartphone app.-Cartridge replacements will cost around $300 for all four._____*Cons:-Once in a while, print jobs over WiFi took TOO long. Inconsistent response times.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D8D7FIKARD1S?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,

It took multiple tries and loads of patience to finally get it done.You have to have a smart phone to install this. I tried to install from my laptop and it wouldn’t. I was required to download an app from Lexmark to just connect my phone and printer. Then I was able to use that app to connect the printer and my internet. Once that was completed I was able to connect to it with the laptop. To print from my phone, it looks like another app is needed.I did to a test print and it seems to be working.

R1I0G70F6ZF1SI,"July 31, 2019",Dale,5,C3224dw,Vine Customer,"Well, it has a lot to live up to. So far so good...","I am using this to replace a Brother laser printer (NO COLOR, NO WIFI) that I have used for 6 years and it was still going strong.So far I don’t regret the upgrade to this Lexmark. While it’s no faster to print than the Brother, it isn’t slower, and is MUCH quieter, which I like in my office setting. Print quality on the whole is excellent. As far as the color printing goes (which I don’t do much of), it looks good, but not great. You won’t confuse it for a photo printer, nor is it intended to be. For color documents, it’s MINT!What I don’t like...well, set up was sort of annoying. The machine prompts you to download the app on your phone, which I did. No matter what I couldn’t get the thing to connect. So I wound up backing out of the set up and doing it manually from the printer. Took forever punching in my cryptic WiFi password with no keyboard. After that, I did get a strange error about the Cyan cartridge. I cleared it and it hasn’t come back, so we will see.Overall it’s well made, has a good “heft” to it. It occupies only about the same space as my old B&W printer, which is impressive. Servicing and toner replacement is easy. It has a lot going for it, and so far I am thrilled with it!***3+ month update**** printer has been perfect. I use it every day and have not had a single paper jam or any other issues.

R31BL20KZA0QSQ,"July 29, 2019",Ugh,5,C3224dw,Vine Customer,A little clunky setup at first but great quality prints,"Printers can be hit-and-miss when it comes to setting them up and this one is no different. Upon powering up, the screen prompts you to approve several settings before eventually reaching a point where you'll continue via Lexmark's mobile app, or, continue with setting up on the printer directly. I opted to go to mobile app route since I'd be connecting to my wi-fi network and entering a password on the printer's minimalist screen would be a pain.On the mobile app, you'll be prompted to connect to a wi-fi signal being output by the printer, and from there you'll tell it what wi-fi network you want IT to connect to, along with the password, and you're set!...or rather...you should be. For me, everything appeared to be setup just fine, but for some reason, I still had to manually select a network and enter the password on the printer itself. Not really sure what went wrong, but that was a little annoying. Once connected, simply install the printer's driver software from the included disc (or download from Lexmark site) and you should be set.Besides that minor inconvenience, printing quality is perfect, and fast. It goes to sleep automatically after a period of not being used, and it doesn't make any noise or mechanical adjustments when being turned on/off, or when sleeping, or being woken. Other printers I've had all seem to make noise when doing this and this sometimes occurred in the middle of the night too, so it'd be a bit startling, but this Lexmark is perfectly quiet in this respect.Overall, really nice printer that does its job well.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BL20KZA0QSQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,3,0,No,
RYLHERBWWYBU8,"July 28, 2019",MWCraft,5,C3224dw,Vine Customer,Excellent Output; Easy Local or WIFI Setup,"Below are my thoughts/observations on the Lexmark C3224dw Color Laser Printer. Some pictures are also included.Setup- the printer box had illustrations on top showing how to remove the printer from the box. I found that helpful and accurate in how best to begin the setup process.- Inside, a two sided sheet showed additional instructions for removing the tape, setting up the toner cartridges (which were already installed) and adding paper- It came with an installation CD for use in setting the printer up as locally attached to a PC. - You will need to supply your own USB printer cord and connect it to the printer and PC. - Turn on the printer; load the CD in your computer’s drive and the install process will begin automatically (I installed it on a Windows 10 desktop). In a couple of minutes, my PC sent a pop-up message that it was done.- While the CD was installing the printer drivers, etc. to my PC, the printer itself also displayed messages on its display screen: - First, it asked if I wanted to setup the phone app. I declined this since I did not want another phone app. - Next, it walked me through the steps to set it up on my home WIFI. This was pretty easy to do but unavoidably repetitive. I.e., if your WIFI name is “KatManDu-74”, you will have to enter each upper/lowercase letter, character or number by repeatedly pressing an arrow key for each one then hitting “OK”. Not difficult to do but boring. This, of course, took longer to complete than the automated process with the CD.Output QualtiyIt is excellent. I printed multiple photographs and they looked great and also printed some test prints and plain text documents that also looked really good.Printing Through WIFIWithout installing any apps to my iPhone or iPad, I was able to print multiple photos even though the WIF router was upstairs and I was in the basement sitting next to the printer. This means the image was transmitted through the floor/walls to the router and back through the floor/walls to the printer without issue.Overall ImpressionsAs stated earlier, I did not install or test any Lexmark printing apps (for the phone or PC) but do not think they are needed for wireless/remote printing. They may have other features (low toner warnings, etc.) that you may desire so, that is a choice you must make..It is quiet, and gives excellent quality output whether locally attached to your PC or sitting as a standalone device on your WIFI. You also have the option of connecting it to your network using an Ethernet cable but I did not test that since making the WIFI connection was so simple.I am very happy with the Lexmark C224DW printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYLHERBWWYBU8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,21,0,No,

R2HIYF66AQ9YY4,"November 5, 2019",Sheena Cousar,5,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,I can't believe this doesn't have all 5 stars!,"Just received this today, so it is possible over time I may change my mind, and if I do, I'll update this review. But it is awesome so far!I'm replacing a 20-year-old high-end Brother printer, so I'll compare it to that. The Brother cost $600 20 years ago, so I was not expecting much at all from a $117 printer.Most of the negative reviews mentioned trouble connecting via WiFi. My first thought was I didn't care about that. I've never had a WiFi printer in the past and didn't see any reason it would be necessary now. However, I have gotten married since 20 years ago and we have kids and more computers in the house, so I figured if it worked that would be great and if not, well, it was only $117 and we didn't have a networked printer in the past so it would be okay.Of course, once it arrived, connecting it to WiFi became my first obsession! I guess I just wanted to try it that cool new feature!I've never connected a printer to WiFi and wasn't sure how it worked. The printed materials that came with the printer were totally useless. It's all pictures, no words and nothing about connecting via Wifi. But, all the info you need, really, is on the printer screen. Even though it's tiny, I was able to get the information I needed from it to connect it up.Basically, I turned the printer on, read the directions as they scrolled across on the tiny screen and followed the directions. It mentioned a Lexmark printer app, which I downloaded. I was able to quickly and easily connect the app on my phone to the printer and from there it was a breeze. It went through the steps and I was able to print from my phone. Which again, was not something I had ever imagined doing, much less anything I needed or wanted to do. But it worked and that was cool!Then it was off to connect two computers to it. First I plugged it in by wire to my wife's computer - which I think might have been a mistake. But at the time I thought that's how you had to do it. For some reason I wasn't able to get it to connect via WiFi on her computer because while the computer ""saw"" the printer, it kept asking me for a WPS PIN which it said was either printed on the printer or was on the printed materials that came with the printer. It was on neither.I gave up on that and went to install it via WiFi only on my computer. Actually I didn't really have to do anything. I opened the Printer Settings on my computer and clicked Add Printer, then find WiFi connected printer and it was right there. So it was already broadcasting the signal to all devices in our house and all I had to do was click Connect - and it worked like a charm. The weird thing though is it didn't ask me for any WPS PIN for my computer. And I'm guessing that's because I never connected it via wire - so it didn't halfway install itself by wire only to get confused by WiFi? I don't know. But I did not ever attach it to my computer with a wire and the WiFi connected up absolutely flawlessly.Then I went back to my wife's computer and using the disk that came with the printer I installed the drivers from that. And once that was done, suddenly it worked fine as a WiFi printer. Although it shows up in Printer Settings as (copy1) of the first attempted installation by wire, which still works if it's plugged in with the wire.Then for the big test. I moved the printer to another room! Would we both be able to print on it from our respective offices? My wife's office is closest and mine is further away... about 50 feet away and several drywall walls. From my wife's office, everything went off without a hitch. From my office - same result. Print Perfect both times.My old $600 Brother printer did excellent color prints, and this one does as well - for 1/6th the price. I printed a few photos from the Lexmark, as a test, and was absolutely amazed at their quality. They're almost photo-printer quality. In fact, if I printed them on laser photo paper, I think they'd look good enough to frame and hang.The other nifty feature is the double-sided print feature. Maybe this is something that's been common among printers for the last few years, I'm not sure. But if you're not used to it, it's very cool. It will print on both sides of the paper - automatically. In other words, you don't have to print on one side and then stick the page in upside down and print the other side manually anymore. It will print the first side, then suck the page back into the printer and print the other side! It's really amazing to watch if you've never seen a printer do this before. And it's so fast.One other plus factor is that it's much smaller and lighter than our old printer. The old one, I literally can't lift by myself it's so darn heavy. Something around 100 pounds I think. But this one is much easier to lift, it's like a heavy suitcase. We also appreciate that it takes up much less space than the old behemoth did.One con so far... they include about 7 or 8 sheets of paper (printed on both sides - that's 16 pages of printing) with nothing other than safety warnings - in every imaginable language. The length of the English text wouldn't take up more than about 2 paragraphs, not even a full page. So it's a colossal waste of paper they include and completely unnecessary. Not to mention the hassle they cause all their customers with so much extra paper they have to throw out. BIG WASTE. I have to think that the United States is their largest market and as such might warrant it's own version of this in English and perhaps Spanish. But no... they literally had to print it in almost every major language on earth - and send it in every major language to every customer! Totally ridiculous, wasteful and annoying.The only instructions are what looks like a hand-drawn diagram with little arrows drawn here and there. Not a single word printed on these two pages - where words would be extremely helpful. Apparently the folks at Lexmark don't want to *offend* anyone by writing in the language/languages spoken in the United States only, so they opt not to print any words at all. As if instructions in English might offend people! Like the United States is such a small market it's not worth their time and effort to print in English and Spanish.Other than that big annoyance though, we're both very pleased with this purchase. I'm still amazed at all the complaints - and really surprised it has only a 3.7-star review score. That's way below where it should be in my humble opinion.I have seen some reviewers say it worked well at first but after a few weeks it went bad. So, if that happens here, I'll come back and definitely adjust my score accordingly, and revise my review to let you know.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HIYF66AQ9YY4?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,238,3,No,

R2XNDMPRWETDW3,"December 18, 2019",Miles,4,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Excellent value for the money,"Lexmark Printer ReviewIf you found this printer difficult to install, then perhaps you are too stupid to own one. It took me longer to take it out of the box than to set it up. I did not use the app, I just plugged it in and used the printer display panel. Took less than 10 minutes from start to finish. I do recommend updating the firmware right after setting it up. It still blows my mind that I am able to buy an excellent quality laser COLOR printer at this price.Print quality is very good. Color saturation and coverage is uniform and rich. I read reviews that complained about how noisy the printer is. That has not been my experience. I only print wireless from Mac, iPhone and Windows without any connectivity problems.I had one problem. Out of the box the printer was printing a series of dots lined vertically 1/2 inch from the right edge, spaced exactly one inch apart on every page. I called Lexmark support who quickly had me run printer diagnostics (again, from the printer display panel). He determined that the problem was caused by the black toner cartridge. He shipped me a new cartridge (full size, not the starter one!), which solved the problem. While it was disappointing to have a problem like this on a brand new printer, Lexmark made up for it. I hope the printer will last for at least 3-4 years, but only time will tell.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XNDMPRWETDW3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,

Nelson,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,No Aftermarket Toner!!,"3 Month Update: I have run low on toner and just discovered there is no aftermarket/generic toners available. I can buy Lexmark high yield toner package for $350 or standard yield for $275. I think I will throw this printer in the garbage and buy something new. I cannot afford toner that expensive, I had just assumed there is always an aftermarket of generic toners, but this printer must not sell in high enough numbers for aftermarket companies to make toners. It will be cheaper for me to throw this away and buy another brand printer that does have aftermarket toners available.Original Review: Home printers are throw away items. They usually don't last more a year, if they do, they need new rollers, drums, etc that cost more than a new printer. My Canon Imageclass MF634cdw was flawless for one year. Got it loaded and up and running in 20 minutes. After one year it started making awful grinding noises and printing badly, etc. Time for something new.This was only $114 and has the auto duplex function. It lacks the all-in-one document feeder and scanner, but I can still use that on my old Imageclass. Setup was difficult (much harder than my Canon was), and the printer could not be detected on my wifi, so I had to google how to load a print driver using an IP address. I've never done this before. Took me about 5 hours to set this printer up on my 2 computers (desktop & laptop), but it prints quickly and quietly. Auto duplex works perfect. After 5 days, it has not gone offline, not had any paper jams, no issues at all.I will update this if I have any issues, but after 5 days, despite some annoyances in getting it up and running, I am very please for only $114.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVJ0L3I075N0B?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,6,0,No,

I've wasted so much money on bad inkjet printers that clog over time not to mention all the ink cartridges. I run a small business and need a printer only sporadically for invoicing and bulk photo printing. The review...1. The setup was not without it's challenges. You just need to make sure that you connect the Wifi to the printer first through the printer control panel then proceed with downloading the appropriate drivers/apps for your device. I found it really easy to connect the devices actually. My Google phone and Chromebook latched on immediately. I could see how others could have issues figuring this out though. I'm fairly tech savvy but it still took me a few minutes of fiddling. I don't understand the lack of included instructions out of the box or online. You really just need a small note card that could walk you through it but nothing, weird. The printing software is nothing to write home about and typically no frills.2. Quality for text is very good of course since it's a laser. Photos are okay. They aren't as poppy or crisp as most inkjets in the same price range but it's passable, at least for my needs. I didn't expect too much for the photo printing (due to reviews I read) but it actually met or exceeded my expectations. If photos are your main interest then you shouldn't be looking at a laser anyway.3. Although this is compact compared to other laser printers, it's not exactly small.

As things go, it isn't bad for the money, but don't expect performance equal to your workgroup printer at the office.The best feature is duplex printing, which is common these days, but not always at the current selling price of this printer. Duplex printing worked as expected. Just don't expect the exaggerated printing speed listed in the product description. You won't get 30+ pages a minute duplex, or even simplex for that matter. We got maybe half that speed. That still isn't bad, though. We're talking four or five seconds a page, which for home use isn't bad at all.Construction is about as you'd expect. This is not one to typically last for years and years. But we've been surprised before (we have a cheap Brother printer that's run for nine years of light use). Still, if you get three or four years out of it, it's well worth it.Setup. Ah yes. It's best to try to get it to run natively if possible. Drivers are hit and miss and depend on your operating system. To make a long story short we can run it on our Linux system as a wired printer but we're still struggling with wireless. Your mileage will vary depending on your operating system. We're pretty sure you'll be eventually be able to get it to work, but if you're not a computer person you will likely end up calling on a knowledgeable friend. Plug and play is not guaranteed.In inexpensive printers such as these the biggest cost is toner cartridges, which often run as much as replacing the printer entirely. Seek out third party cartridges which can cost as little as one-sixth as much. Read reviews to assess quality, of course.Bottom line: four stars.

I have had this printer less than one year, and the duplex feature has broken. The printer still tries to force duplexing often, but as it goes to pull the paper back in after printing the first side, it jams every time. I cannot turn off the double-sided printing on the printer (and have it stay that way). I have to remember every time I print (which is a big time-waster) to turn it off.-------------------I am amending my review after using this printer for awhile. I changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars. It takes some getting used to.I was used to just putting things in the manual feed slot (checks, envelopes, special paper, etc.) and my old printer would always auto-select it when it sensed something there. This one, you need to make sure your print option is manual feed to avoid problems/jams.It still always defaults to duplex when I don't want it, making my print twice sometimes and waste more paper than its green ""enviro-leaf"" symbol is trying to save, but oh well, the wacky world we live in now.---------------------------------[old review below]I run a busy small office. I keep a printer on my desktop for small jobs, printing checks, and envelopes, and I send large jobs to my network printer. I have used this printer for a few weeks now.First the good:This printer is fast and the print quality is good.The bad:1. The separate single feed slot that I use for checks and envelopes doesn't draw well and has to be almost always separately selected when a job is sent to print. It jams all the time. A big waste of time and this problem alone means that I would never recommend this printer.2. When regular letter-sized paper is put in the main tray, you have to open the rear door of the printer (like you were using over-sized paper) and leave it open, else the main tray won't fit in.3. I don't duplex much of my work, but it keeps reverting to duplexing after every time I change the settings (I guess it's trying to force ""saving the planet"" on me, instead of allowing me to use it how best works for my business)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3M22TBFV1XCXW?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,4,0,No,

If I could review it based on that alone, it would be a 5 star inexpensive printer. It does have duplex (double sided printing) though it did take me some time to figure this out. Once I figured it out, it is a nice feature.But, and this is a big one, the set up for a non tech savvy person depends all on interpreting the photo on the enclosed insert. There are no written instructions. I was able to figure out how to set this up to my wireless network just by plugging it in and following the prompts on the printer screen. I didn't think it was difficult but it definitely takes someone who would think of it instead of relying on directions. There are plugs to connect it directly to a computer but I wanted this for the wireless capability.The size of the printer is a little big for the lack of other functions and I wish the cord were just a tad longer so it would reach the plug I use in my printing area. One other issue for me is that the print cartridges for this printer seem expensive for a cheaper printer.One more odd thing worth mentioning is that the tray does extend (though hard to find) but even for regular size letter paper, it pushes open the back cover tray cover.

This leads to some confusion. The cd installs scanner software, but the printer is not a scanner. There is a power button in front which lights up white but, in order to print you need an unlabeled blue light to be lit and the power light in front to be off. For the blue light to come on you need to press the OK button, the power light turns off, and “Ready” appears on the digital display. Granted, it’s not hard to learn, but it’s hardly intuitive or logical. On the website, I read that it has an ‘active’ and a ‘sleep’ mode.’ Maybe this is an explanation for the weird light situation.There is also a slight confusion in the process of setting up the paper tray. There is a rather stiff blue spring control that you need to press (hard) to take it to letter size (or legal or A4). Once you get past that, it’s uphill from there. The printing quality and speed are great. The ease of printing two-sided is also a great plus. In addition to the paper tray which pulls out from the bottom and holds an impressive amount of paper, there is an additional tray for manual feeding in case you need to print an envelope or a different size of paper than what you have loaded on the tray. When you’re on the printing dialog, just select page setup and you get to select which tray you want. If you don’t select page setup the default is to feed paper from the main tray.All in all, it’s a great little printer. It fits anywhere; it prints fast and sharp; one toner will yield about 6,000 pages; and it will work as a wireless printer or connected via USB from your computer or phone or other device.

If Lexmark fixes those or even some, I would give this printer 5 stars.Setup:After removing all the tape that holds things together for shipping, you'll pull the toner cartridge - along with the drum - out of the front panel and remove both the paper protecting the drum and the activating strip from the toner cartridge. Put them back then plug in the cord and use the display to set region, date, and time. Now you need to install the driver from the included disc.I installed the driver from the disc, but the setup software could not detect the printer on my network (wireless). I went into setup on the printer and connected it to my wireless network. This can take a bit of time as you have to scroll through the alphabet for each character of your network password.Afterward, I went to the install screen on my computer and installed the printer using the IP address. Now it works. Put paper in the tray. You have to move the dividers around before you paper will fit. And, oddly, the tray protrudes from the back of the printer with letter size paper.Printing:I printed a two page Word document using duplex printing. The printer is very fast and automatically reverses the page to print the back side. The printer defaults to duplex printing which is probably not your default preference. You'll have to select single side printing in Printer Setup in your program and you'll have to do this for each different document. Anyone know how to set single side printing as default?

First, the good:1. Print quality is crisp, as you'd expect from a laser printer.2. Printing is fast. I don't feel like I'm hanging around, waiting for the printer to do its thing. That's after it's downloaded the data from WiFi, of course, which varies a lot by content.3. Small footprint. It really is a small machine, although it's deeper than an average bookshelf. It'll hang off the front or back, unlike other machines I've used that are wider (than deep).4. Reasonable setup. I installed from the DVD, although I suspect that wasn't necessary. It did install a very annoying pop-up ""information"" screen that also started appearing when I use my other Lexmark. I ended up uninstalling this, since it was useless and annoying.5. No problems with WiFi. It was set up and ready to go in a couple of minutes, and hasn't dropped or had any issues.Now the not-so-good:1. LOUD. When is was initializing, I thought it was about to take off for the moon, but it quieted down a little after that. Now it's just loud when... printing. It's easily the loudest printer I've used, so it's not a good choice if you're using it while on calls or otherwise don't want to listen to it all day.2. Tiny touchscreen. I have pretty small fingers (ladies size medium), and I had a heck of a time adding the WiFi password (for example). It's incredibly easy to fat-finger virtually everything, so using the screen is an exercise in patience and repetition (try again... try again...) That said, the touchscreen responds well.3. Flimsy build quality. The print drawer doesn't insert smoothly, and doesn't feel durable at all. All the hinges open/close slightly skewed, and take more effort than they should (and make me worry I'm going to break this thing). While flimsy printer drawers seem to be a Lexmark thing, I'd hoped they would improve on this for the new models. Nope.4. Way overpriced. The older MC series offers multi-functions at a cheaper price than this model. Since the touchscreen and print functions are the same on that series, I'm really not sure how the price of this single-function model is justified. It's just a printer. For a similar footprint and print experience, the MC series is a far better value.Recommended for: Someone who values a small footprint, doesn't mind the noise, and doesn't care about copying, faxing, or scanning, nor wants more than 1 print drawer.

I took it straight out of the box, plugged it in and entered my wifi information into it and connected it to my chromebook with google print. It took me a little while, but I'm attributing that to cloud print because I have that issue whenever I connect a new printer. I still havent been able to get it fully connected, but was able to print a test page to see the quality and the print quality and color were very nice. The colors came aout vibrant, there were no lines or smudges or imperfections on the page. The touchscreen is responsive. I wasn't able to connect to the app through my phone or chromebook, however, for some reason it would not find the printer. I checked the price of the toner and it is pretty high, it ranges from $65-$103 for different colors EACH.

R3OORQH2V2YHPH,"April 19, 2020",Blayne,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,Set up and printing wirelessly in under 10 minutes,"Review of: **Lexmark C3426dw Color Laser Printer**I literally unpacked this printer, set it up on its box on the floor, and was printing wirelessly from a laptop in under 10 minutes. No joke. All it required was to unpack the printer, follow the printed unpacking instructions to remove the tape and plastic protective tabs (I recommend using the printed instructions here because there were a set of shipping ""tabs"" in the print toner compartment that I would have missed), adding paper, and then following the manual on-screen setup prompts to get it online.I did use the WPS wifi config on my router to set this up. This is basically a simplified way to get the printer on your wireless network without even needing to enter the wifi password. I simply went through the setup on the printer, and then when it says to press the WPS button (within 120 seconds), press it (usually on the bottom of your router) and that was it. The printer was done configuring wireless. After the, a couple of steps to set the date/time/time zone, and I was done.Next, I added some paper to the tray and went into the Printer setup on my MacBook, picked the new Lexmark printer (it automatically appeared in the list of printers available), and I was done. I printed a page or two to test it, and also successfully printed from my iPhone X doing nothing more than selecting the Lexmark printer that automatically was listed as my (only) option to print (I don't have any other wireless printers online on my home network). Same story for my wife's laptop - absolutely seamless and simple setup.I have printed a few docs and other files so far, and am very impressed with the overall print quality. Sharp text, vibrant colors, and even pictures - which inexpensive laser printers are not really the best choice for printing on - look very good. And this is printing on stock office printer paper, nothing fancy. And I absolutely love having the option to print double-sided pages (duplex) without having to have the printer print on one side and then re-feed the paper into the printer upside down.Print speed is excellent, when warmed up this thing essentially prints instantly. When cold, it takes a few seconds - with a somewhat noisy fan kicking on - to get warmed up and then prints. Printing multiple pages is VERY fast for a light duty office printer. They claim 26ppm, or a page every ~2 seconds, and I have no doubt that is accurate.The only downsides I see are:-The printer is fairly heavy. The specs say about 35 pounds, but it almost feels heavier due to it's compact size.-Some of the construction feels a little cheap, in particular some of the plastic parts. When you open the toner door, you can feel a lot of flex in the plastic panel. And the plastic arms that allow the toner cartridge shelf to pull out feel very flimsy, like they would break if you pulled too hard. Nothing has actually broken yet, but some of these pieces could have been made of or reinforced with some metal.-There is no scanner. I know, this model is not sold as a MFP (multi-function printer), so I am not dinging it due to this. But keep it in mind if you need the option to use your printer as a copier.-The paper tray has to be extended out for legal size paper, making the depth of the printer a few inches more. (It took me a few minutes to figure out how this printer could accept legal size paper at all, like the product information states. The manual isn't very clear, but you need to extend the paper tray outward toward the front of the printer, and when you do this, the white plastic face plate actually sticks out further than when you are using letter size paper or smaller. If you want to print on 8.5x17 paper you have to use the manual feed slot just above the paper tray.)I cannot comment on how long the toner cartridges will last or the long term durability/reliability since I have only been using the printer for a few days. Should I discover anything in these areas that is an issue, I will update this review.From a print quality and performance, this gets a solid 5 stars for a ~$400 laser printer. I am dropping half of a one star from my overall rating due to the slight flimsiness in some of the plastic parts and the inability to handle paper larger than letter size from the print tray without making it stick out. That makes my overall rating 4.5 stars (rounding up to 5 for the Amazon review limitations).If you are looking for a solid laser print performer in a home office or small office with a small footprint, I highly recommend you consider this Lexmark C3426dw model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OORQH2V2YHPH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,6,0,No,
R35ZD0PWWYE2R1,"April 19, 2020",Walter,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, a little difficult to setup","We needed a color printer for our office and thought this would be a good choice. The small footprint is a huge plus since we have limited space. The initial setup was easy enough using my wife’s Chromebook and the printer’s touchscreen. But we had to use the included CD before the Windows 10 laptops would recognize it. That slowed things down considerably.Out of the box there is a lot of tape and tags to be removed, but there is an instruction sheet with pictures to show you where to find them. There is also a cd containing an app that needed to be installed on each of our Windows laptops before they could find the printer. There were no other instructions. It some tinkering and about an hour to get all 3 Win10 laptops to print anything so some instructions would have been nice. There was a very bothersome SMTP error that wouldn’t go away even once the printer was printing. I had to reboot the laptop and unplug the printer to resolve the issue.Once the setup was complete everything went smoothly. The printer works just fine printing single or double-sided pages in black and white or in color. Printing is relatively silent. The speed is good, but not great at 26 ppm. Hopefully the toner lasts as long as Lexmark claims as the biggest drawback to any printer is the cost of running it.As for quality it does a great job with text and graphics, but I wouldn’t recommend it for photos. We tested it by printing our multicolor brochures that contain some colorful infographics and backgrounds. These looked quite nice and are much higher quality that the inkjet we were using. I also tried printing a couple of photos, but they were lack-luster and rather dull. My inkjet does a much better job in that regard.One note about shipping: while the Amazon box was in good condition, the printer box inside was damaged. Fortunately, the printer was not.So far so good. I have another Lexmark printer that we stopped using before the end of the first week because it couldn’t print even a single page job without jamming. But this one has lasted 3 days without any jams. Hopefully this will continue.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35ZD0PWWYE2R1?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,0,0,No,

RBTHRAZ152JT9,"September 10, 2019",Matthew R,5,B2236dw,Vine Customer,"Fast black and white.  No ink drying issues like inkjet.  Wireless, USB or Ethernet","I do like this printer but my out of box experience was not great. I unboxed it and removed the tape from the various locations that are supposed to keep things in place during shipping. I answered a few questions on the little screen like what language do I speak and timezone, etc. Then I adjusted the paper tray to fit Letter size paper. With letter paper, the drawer hangs out of the back of the printer a little. I said to keep the paper size as letter and it said to clear a jam in the back of the printer.Well, I assumed it had to do with the paper tray since that stuck out. It was actually a piece in the door on the back of the printer that was causing the issue. Once I opened that drawer and put the piece in properly, everything went well.I got the driver from the Lexmark website. I plugged it in via ethernet and the IP address conveniently displayed on the screen. I was able to print right away.I have to say that these little printers are pretty impressive these days. I worked on laser printers and even repaired them way back in the HP 4 days. Those printers could not duplex and didn't print anywhere near as fast as these modern laser printers.I think this is a nice desk printer for someone in an office or home office. It is a great little home printer. The biggest thing for me is that it is laser and not inkjet. I have tried to use color inkjets for years. They print nice quality and the color is great. The downside is that I don't print color all that often and when I do print it is almost always black and white. (or black and white would be acceptable at least for my purposes) The ink would always dry up between uses on my inkjet printers and the ink costs more than the printer. (like razors and razor blades)It turns out that toner for this laser is quite expensive and depending on how you order it, it can be close to the price of the printer. (though the price here is very good at the moment at around $100) There are 3 different capacity toners. If you use the Lexmark return program, you save a lot of money. (you give them the empty cartridge back and you save a ton)I'm sure there will be 3rd party toner options at some point but this is what I found on the Lexmark site as far as pricing for the return program toner:Lexmark B221000 Black Return Program Toner CartridgeB221000 1200 $44.99Lexmark B221H00 Black High Yield Return Program Toner CartridgeB221H00 3,000 $79.99Lexmark B221X00 Black Extra High Yield Return Program Toner CartridgeB221X00 6,000 $159.99I only listed the price of the return program toners because the other ones are really expensive and it wouldn't make sense to buy them. (just return it and save a lot) I assume that 3rd party toners will be available at some point and may not require you to return them for a reasonable price.I have no complaints about the printer. It is somewhat compact, quiet and fast. It even prints duplex (2-sided) if you want. I love that it is WiFi capable. I had several old HP printers laying around my house that had good toner in them until fairly recently. I was basically able to print for free. They smelled bad, took up too much space and took forever to warm up.These modern, compact, desktop printers are pretty impressive. I think if you compare the cost of toner for this printer with an inkjet printer, the laser is a little less expensive on paper. In the real world, however, if you have to change your ink cartridges in your inkjet because they dried out, the laser is way less expensive.I do keep a color inkjet around for printing photos. I do not look forward to using it and going through the cleaning cycles and possibly buying ink cartridges when it has sat too long. For most of my printing, this little guy will do what I want.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBTHRAZ152JT9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,2,0,No,
R3E4SR1S3M306F,"August 6, 2019",D. Michael Elkins,4,B2236dw,Vine Customer,"Mac users, please set up using a printer cable!"," I spent at least a half hour trying to figure out how to set up this printer to use with my Mac computer and laptop today. Visit the Lexmark website and you'll see a message that makes it appear that there isn't a driver available but then there's also something to download that will download but won't readily open with any application. I then just tried to add the printer using the ""add printer"" command in the system preferences but the computers could not find the printer. I was then about ready to give up when I noticed an option of connecting the printer by using a printer cable, which of course, is never supplied with any printer that you buy. I salvaged one from an old printer, attached it to my computer and the printer and the printer showed up immediately as one of my ""add printer"" options. Once I had added the printer, I was able to disconnect the cable and it printed flawlessly thereafter through my office's wireless network.Something that I found strange was when I tried to load up standard 8x11 copy paper. Although you wouldn't expect it, to load what I consider the standard size paper, you must extend the back of the tray from its normal configuration, which causes the back of the tray to extend out from the back of the printer, as seen in the attached picture. Why?Once I was able to get the printer up and running, I had no problems with it operating smoothly and quickly as can be seen in my video.I am using this printer as a replacement for my workhorse Brother HL-L2370DW, which still works fine but for the annoying warning about me needing to replace parts, even after they have already been replaced. Yes, I have searched online for the fix but the suggested one didn't work. You would think that if a unit is smart enough to know when it is time to replace a part, it should be smart enough to know when that part has been replaced without the owner having to go online to determine how to reset the warning indicator.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E4SR1S3M306F?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,2,0,No,
R20RGYCO94IM01,"August 5, 2019",FieryXeph,4,B2236dw,Vine Customer,"Really nice laser printer, but lacks instruction",This laser printer is great! First thing I noticed right out of the box is that it is SUPER light. I had no issues removing it from the box and carrying it over. There is a grip on the bottom of the printer so you do not have to worry about it sliding. The printer does lack instructions I feel for setting up. I looked through all the box but there are only warning and a physical setup for the device. One thing about the physical device setup is that you need to make sure to remove all the table and the covers for the toner cartridge. I would recommend that when removing the covers for the toner to do it possibly outside. The reason being is that there is a plastic tab you need to pull and remove. I honestly though I would break it pulling this plastic strip out but it does take a good amount of pull to remove. Do not worry this is something you NEED to remove to bring printing. It will carry about a small amount of toner if you are pulling on it so doing it outside will ensure you do not get toner all over your desk or carpet. Also when remove the paper cover just cut or rip it slowly and remove it. There is a part on the toner you do not want to touch. There is a drive disk if you need it but if you do not have it a simple google of the model will take you to the download page. The paper tray will have not have the paper completely pushed down and that's okay. It will be elevated in the tray. The screen just traditional black and white. There is no color or visual and the controls are fairly easy to navigate once you get use to it. The setup was a bit annoying as it loops for some reason through a lot of the setup. The printer does use a traditional computer plug to power the device and uses a type b usb cable. Be aware that the device does not come with that cable so if you want to do a direct connection you will need to purchase that separately. You can manually set up the wifi on the device itself just be aware you will have to rotate through all of the different characters. I have not had any connection issues and once on the internet network you can easily search for the printer on the network and connect to it. The printer prints super fast. It can shoot out the printout in I would say 1-2 seconds after it is done warming up. You do not have to wait very long to get the print out. It has all the indicator lights to show low on toner or low on paper. It is not a very big printer so you do not have to worry about it taking up too much space. Overall this print is a nice printer to have if you only print in black and white as well as want something that will last you a long time before replacing the toner. It also great to have for a small office as well. The only issue I have is the instructions apart from the physical setup is lacking.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20RGYCO94IM01?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,0,0,No,

R2IL5WOCYEQBP6,"April 19, 2020",Hyytekk,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Why do printer manufacturers assume everyone employs an IT department?,"Printers are supposed to be patient servants who sit idle, but snap to attention when you need them. They do seem too if you have a wired connection. Adding Wifi seems to reduce the printer's IQ by half. Unless you have your own IT department or a 12 year old close by to rescue you. Now that that's out of the way, here are my impressions of this Lexmark B3340 so far. I was looking for a replacement for my Cannon, that was most of all intuitive and whose Wifi just plain worked every time. Unboxing seemed promising but suspect since documentation included one sheet of printed media and a DVD. The single sheet of ""instructions"" contained no words, just a few cave wall drawings with a helpful bent page indicator in the lower right hand corner indicating the need to turn the page over to continue. Good thing, I never would have noticed it was printed on both sides! Step 12 indicates you need to turn the printer on. The final step indicates you insert the DVD into your laptop. If only laptops still had DVD readers. In my Apple world those are barely even remembered. So there we both sat in awkward silence.There is a tiny, single line display so I decided to break the ice and start pushing the few buttons there. It asked if I wanted to set it up using an app. Yes please. I downloaded the only Lexmark app I could find onto my phone, but that proved to be a dead end. I used my iMac to try to locate drivers for the B3340 and finally wading through microscopic online print and charts seemed to find what I needed so clicked the hyperlink for Mac. Nothing downloaded. I connected the printer to my desktop to see if that might make a love connection. I thankfully had the correct cable. Would have been nice if Lexmark had included one but maybe no one does that any more. Though others seem to make even a tiny effort to give you a modicum of direction. I opened my Printer preference tab, and by golly, it had recognized the new printer. Clicking on some options seemed promising but still no directions. I went back to that single line display and started clicking through and eventually found an option to connect to Wifi. It found my network thankfully and asked for my password. I hoped there might be a more handy input method. But no, you need to go through small a, capital A, small b capital B, etc. for each part of your password. Mine dutifully is 10 characters long so it was a lot of tapping. Eventually all was set up, and I directed the computer to print a page and selected the Lexmark. Thankfully it instantly printed the page, though the quality seemed a little light and non-crisp. Imagining there were internal adjustments I went back to single line display, but nothing there. In the mean time the printer went into sleep mode. I opened the Printer choices but nothing helpful there. After pushing the back arrow on the printer it said it was ""ready"" and fully awake. Thats when, in the Printer section under the ""general"" tab, there was a tiny box that said it would take you to the printer web site. I bit, and although it's not obvious at all, there are nests of settings that will adjust your printer, including print quality and darkness level. I made the adjustments, printed another page and the page was beautiful. I was interrupted but returned to make sure all was in order, tried to print another page but nothing. It said it couldn't find the printer. Ten minutes later, the page printed.Over all, this seems to be a solid relatively compact printer. It says it's made out of steel though the exterior seems like hard plastic. The single line of display gives basic information only after lots of clicking and little intuitive guidance. Once all is set up to the settings of your choice, it seems promising. I cancelled sleep mode but it still seems to doze off and not print wirelessly on command. I'll keep tinkering. In conclusion, unit build seems solid, compact and unencumbered by buttons and blinking lights. Five stars there. As for helpful setup directions or any guidance I would give it zero stars if possible. I believe this will prove to be a solid, reliable printer. As long as I don't need to wake it up by physically pushing a button on the controls, and the wifi proves reliable, I should be happy. If you're reading Lexmark, can't you simply include a second piece of printed instructions that gives a buyer even a scrap of guidance? At least for customers who exist in the Apple universe, or with Windows laptops that lack DVD access?",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2IL5WOCYEQBP6?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,13,1,No,
RG94MZQ2YVFD9,"April 17, 2020",LifeIsGood,5,B3340dw,Vine Customer,Great monochrome laser for the home/small office,"This is a compact, somewhat lightweight black & white laser printer. No scanner, fax, or copier. But as a printer it is excellent. Print speeds are fast at just about 1.5 seconds per page and the built-in duplexer is great. The instructions are just pictures, which can be a bit confusing, but once you have the printer out of the box they make more sense. This only comes with a power cable so if you're going to connect directly to a computer you will need a printer cable (that funky cable with a squarish connector). Because of all our devices we went with the wireless option for connectivity. The 2-line monochrome screen is used to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Again, no instructions. If you've set up a printer before this is not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that your network has to be 2G and not 5G. It does come with a CD but I prefer to download the latest from the manufacturer's website. This is a 100MB download for the full package. The Lexmark app installed fine on my Android tablet (Samsung) and I was able to print from there as well. This is a simple but very nice B&W laser that works well for any home office or even a small business office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG94MZQ2YVFD9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,3,0,No,

It prints incredibly fast and the pages are perfect. Blacks are smooth and dark while the white page is clean and smudge free. Setup was almost a breeze. I did have trouble connecting to wifi but it eventually worked out. The printer does make a little grunt after each round of printing, but I'm assuming that's normal. I removed the drum and reseated it a few times without any difference in this response. Otherwise, everything works well.Ignore other reviews that say this printer can hold an extra large toner that prints 6000 pages. I have confirmed with Lexmark that this particular model, B2338adw, cannot use that cartridge. The standard cartridge prints up to 3000 pages which is excellent for most people. The included starter cartridge prints 1500 pages. Unfortunately, this printer doesn't seem to be able to hold generic toner cartridges so you are locked into the Lexmark cartridges and prices.I prefer this laser printer over my inkjet printer. I used to set my inkjet to print in grayscale only because the ink is expensive and I don't print photos or need color for personal use. My inkjet is now in the closet.

R3QASHFMI7T7GV,"November 27, 2018",Tom Steele,2,B2338dw,Vine Customer,Disposable,"I didn't do my research before ordering this printer. In this day and age, I didn't really think that I would have to because usually you can find aftermarket toner cartridges on the cheap, but I'm having trouble finding toner cartridges for the Lexmark B2338adw Monochrome Laser Printer other than the $87 Lexmark return cartridge here on Amazon.If you do the math, that means that the printer is worth about $20 and the toner is worth $90! To be fair, the starter toner is a specially loaded toner cartridge with far less toner than the regular one, so it could be argued that the printer is $50 - maybe. But if you think about it, you could easily make a case for just ordering a new printer every time the toner runs out, rather than using the same printer and ordering new toner each time.I feel like this is deceiving. It would be far more honest to sell the printer with a REAL CARTRIDGE that is loaded full and charge the full price - that way you would know what it was going to cost you in real world dollars and perhaps more importantly, you could comparison shop and see what it actually costs compared to other printers. The REAL price of this printer is the price of the printer PLUS a toner cartridge which is closer to $200 than $100.Otherwise, this looks like a decent laser printer that will handle heavy printing loads and is easy to set up with Windows or Mac. But I am so put off by the marketing and price of the cartridges that I don't know if I trust the company with my business.Before you school me on the fact that all printer companies do this, I am aware that it is a common practice - but I have never seen it quite so blatant or so costly. Usually you can bypass the printer company's overpriced toner or ink and save money. But for whatever reason, there appear to be no choices except Lexmark's expensive toner. I'd shop around and find a printer that isn't going to cost quite so much in consumables as time goes on.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QASHFMI7T7GV?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,6,1,No,
R1XPSFP7O7Q5GQ,"November 19, 2018",Terry,4,B2338dw,Vine Customer,Perfect for home use and multiple options for printing wirelessly,"This Lexmark B2338adw Print Only Monochrome Laser Printer is perfect for home use and has multiple options for printing from your computer, your phone or your tablet.Understand that this is a laser printer. Laser printers print very differently from ink jet printers. It uses powdered toner which is attracts to the paper via an electric charge. A fuser permanently fuses the toner to the paper. Hence, there are no print heads or liquid ink. This process makes a laser printer and attractive choice for people who do not print large amounts or frequently as there are no print heads to get clogged or ink to dry up.Although there are color laser printers, this is a monochrome printer so only one toner cartridge, which is easy to install and replace and all of the toner is available for use as laser printers don't need priming, as ink jet printers do. Laser printers also produce incredibly crisp prints.One thing to note is that the toner cartridge for this printer is currently ~$90. Before you gasp, realize that the toner cartridge is rated for about 3,000 pages. There is a greater initial outlay for a laser printer toner cartridge but you don't generally replace them as often as ink jet cartridges. This printer comes with a starter toner cartridge installed, which is rated for about 1,500 pages.You can use this printer directly connected to your computer via a USB printer cable (NOT included), over your wifi network or as a wired network printer via an ethernet cable (NOT included.) Lexmark has a free app called the Lexmark Mobile Assistant to help you set the printer up. I have an android phone and I downloaded the app but for some reason, it couldn't find the printer. I didn't try for long because you can actually set it up using the control panel on the printer. You just need to know the name of your wifi network and the password. The printer connected instantly to my wifi network.Next, I tried installing the software on the included CD but again, ran into some issues with the software not finding the printer. I skipped that and went into my Windows Control Panel, selected Hardware and Sound, and then selected Advanced Printer Setup. It found the printer and when I selected it, Windows automatically installed the drivers for the printer and prompted me to print a test page to ensure it was working properly. The test page printed instantly and perfectly.If you have a Chromebook, you won't be able to connect the printer to your computer via a USB printer cable. Instead, you will use Google Cloud Print, which you will need to set up. You can also print wirelessly via Apple AirPrint, Mopris Print Service and Lexmark Mobile Print so you have a lot of options for printing from your phone or tablet.This is a printer only. It doesn't scan or copy as it is not an all-in-one printer. It does, however, have auto duplexing, which is automatic, double sided printing. It has a 250 sheet paper tray and a multi-purpose feeder for envelopes and specialty papers. It prints very quickly - even double sided pages. Print quality is excellent.My only complaint is that, like many printers these days, there is no printed user manual included. You can download it from the Lexmark website, though. While you are there, note that there is a firmware update available for this printer. You'll need to download the update and follow the directions carefully to install the update. Firmware updates are important and shouldn't be ignored so take time to do this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XPSFP7O7Q5GQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,22,0,No,
RD86FQB3VIH0L,"November 19, 2018",Robert,4,B2338dw,Vine Customer,High quality printer with full AirPrint support for the Mac and iPhone,"This is an excellent printer for Mac users, especially if you have in iPhone. There is a two page cartoon showing how to unpack it, and the only confusing thing is that there is both a toner cartridge and an imaging unit into which the toner cartridge fits. When the printer arrives, both items are installed but with packing tape and pads surrounding them and they must be removed. The cartoons are not all that helpful in figuring out what to remove, but it is fairly obvious when you have the item in your hand. Just make sure all the tape and foam padding are removed and replace the imaging unit first, and then put the toner cartridge in next.The software setup is trivial if you have an iPhone. Download the Lexmark Mobile Print app from the app store and follow the prompts. I was done in less than a minute and the printer was then available via air print on all the other mac computers and phones in the house. The WIFI on this printer is highly stable.The reason I gave this only four stars is that Lexmark charges too much for its toner cartridges. Indeed, the toner cartridge for this printer costs more than the printer! Furthermore, the printer comes with a starter toner cartridge that will only last a few months at most. So my strong recommendation is to buy the printer + toner package. It will save you about $20.That complaint noted, this is an outstanding and reliable printer. For mac users it is especially nice because AirPrint has been fully implemented, which is not the case for many printers I have bought which claim to support it, but have only a partial implementation.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD86FQB3VIH0L?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F4J2STN,5,0,No,

This device arrives with a toner cartridge that is stated to print 1500 copies which is half the regular cartridge (B231000) capacity of 3000 copies. If interested, there is also a high-yield cartridge available.Printing can be accomplished through any device connected to the printer’s network. To use a mobile device, like a smartphone or tablet, the Lexmark Print app must be loaded. In Windows 10 no app is needed– just set up like any other printer.

The 2 by 1/2 inch illuminated display window stated—setup using the mobile app. At the Apple app store I installed the Lexmark Mobile Assistant.The app instructed I should go to Settings on iPhone, find printer name shown on the printer display and connect to my local WiFi network using my network passphrase.

In the configuration settings a pin number may be created that applies to all jobs or individually at print time. In either case there is no output until the user types in the pin number at the printer console. Printing can be restricted to network users and/or local accounts.Also the user can erase (sanitize) printer memory (automatically saved image) to avoid sensitive documents being reprinted without authorization.

It stopped recognizing magenta cartridges so it was time for a new printer. I put the C2325dw is the same spot as our old Brother printer. Same AC plugin, same Network cable. The new Lexmark acted very flaky. It refused to stay connected. It refused to play with the Lexmark App on my phone when in Wifi Setup mode. I ended up having to update the firmware - which appeared to be old.After updating the firmware and changing out power and network cables it seems to be working a little better. My fingers are crossed that one of these things really fixed the problem.The printer is persnickety about how the paper is placed in the tray. The tray has the paper in at a angle rather then square. With my brother printer, you just adjusted the guides and there were no issues. The Lexmark the paper slides and it's feeder seems to care. It took a few tries to get the paper to feed out of the tray without error. I think have the hang of it now, but the infographic setup that was in the box was not of any help with this issue.The print quality seems pretty good - except for that line the runs down middle of the page when printing color prints. It's okay for regular printing, but for photos it really shows. Perhaps as it is broken in and run for a bit, this will improve.The reason I had a Brother printer orignally is that the consumables are cheap. You can buy 3rd party toner for peanuts. This printer the toner appears to be $60-$80 per color. With the Brother I could get toner for all the colors and two for black for that price. I'm hoping the printer came with high capacity cartridges because - yikes.Given the pain needed to get the printer up - I think I'm being generous giving it 3 stars.

This for one thing is a pretty nice machine. The thing right out of the box looks great. The install was another story. I don't know why, but printers in our home has always been a struggle. They are always difficult. This was a little tricky to get set up and install. I had some trouble getting it onto my network. The process took a little over 30 minutes to get everything up and going and talking to one another. After the install, I was impressed at how nice this is. The printer makes clean crisp copies and prints pretty fast too. The most challenging part was setting up, if you can get it all installed ok, then I would highly recommend this printer.

R1ACLY7MSY220Y,"November 25, 2018",WryGuy2,4,C2325dw,Vine Customer,Good quality printing,"I received this printer to review as part of the Amazon Vine program. Below are my pros/cons.Pros:- Very good quality printing (easily better than my old inkjet printer).- Prints pages quickly; when printing single-sided, this baby can really spit the printed pages out.- Comes with duplex included (both-sided printing).- It's smooth; it doesn't shake ""back-and-forth"" like my old ink-jet printer did when printing.- Seems designed to be largely idiot-proof, and I'm the idiot testing it.Cons:- Instructions were a single sheet with several large diagrams; I followed the items and was able to get the printer up and running. NOTE - install the printer drivers using the supplied disk, not by searching the internet. Also note that you do have an option to download stuff to your cell phone, but I'm old school and prefer to have an instruction manual included and in front of me.- The printer did not print ""duplex"" right out of the box. Here is where the lack of a printed manual with a ""troubleshooting"" section was sorely felt. I had to go online, where I found a solution: ""confirm that the paper type selected on your printer corresponds to the media actually loaded into the printer. Do this through the printer driver (Paper tab) as well as the printer operator panel (Paper Menu). IMPORTANT: Labels and transparencies will print on one side of the page only (simplex) regardless of the printer or driver settings. If the media type is set to Labels or Transparency, change the setting to allow for duplex printing.""- The printer jammed a lot and often grabbed more than one sheet of paper. I'm hoping this will lessen, as I get used to this printer's idiosyncrasies.Things worth noting (neither a pro nor a con):- This is advertised as a single function printer, and it is ... single function means no copying or scanning ... all it does is print. Read the manufacturer provided info carefully.- While the printer isn't overly large, it is heavy ... around 50 pounds.- It has a paper cassette tray, and there is a slot where you can feed letters, envelopes, and transparencies in manually.Overall, I like this printer, and am looking forward to getting a lot of use out of it. If you can afford it, the time to shift to color laser printers has arrived. Four stars.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ACLY7MSY220Y?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07FDJQR32,21,0,No,
R2GZW5YP3DT6VY,"November 20, 2018",Lenny,4,C2325dw,Vine Customer,"Incredibly frustrating setup, but good print quality. No network security.","I'm rating this based on how it works as a printer, not according to the incredibly frustrating setup. If I'm rating the installation experience, I'd have given it at most 2 stars - and only because I managed to figure it out in the end through experimentation and trial and error.Instead of describing my arduous installation experience, I'm just going to give a list of tips of what you should do.1. I wanted to use this over WiFi. If you can use it over wired Ethernet, it might be much simpler.2. I tried to configure it with the front panel. If you have a long WiFi password, please reconsider. I entered it anyway, taking 5 minutes to enter it, and it wouldn't connect to my WiFi.3. I'm using an Android phone. The Lexmark Mobile Assistant only configures the WiFi settings. It will ask you to connect to the printer's WiFi through Settings.4. If you see a warning message on Android saying there's no Internet connection after you're connected to it, and to tap on it for options, TAP ON IT FOR OPTIONS. Accept that it has no Internet connection. I didn't do that, and as a result, the Mobile Assistant would not go on to the next step.5. After you've configured WiFi, the printer may kick you back to pick language, and ask if you want to use Mobile Assistant for setup again. If it does that, reply NO. Then, when it comes to the screen where it asks you if you want to configure WiFi, say NO. It will then say ""Connected"".Getting to step 5 above took me 2 hours of trial and error and multiple restarts.6. Check to see if you need a firmware update. Lexmark's website has a good description of how to update firmware. The C2325dw does not have a USB A port at the back, so you need to do either FTP or through the internal web server.7. The web server is a much more user friendly procedure, but it wouldn't complete for me. The printer showed a CRC error after 45%, and eventually rebooted. If it works for you, skip step 8.8. I updated it with Windows FTP client. If Windows prompt you to give it firewall permission, grant it. The instructions did not tell you to first put the client in binary transfer mode. So instead of just ""PUT <filename>"", I first issued ""BIN"", then ""HASH"" (optional, to show hash marks as it's uploading so that I know it's still transferring) then finally ""PUT <filename>"". This worked. Printer rebooted and showed new firmware.9. To install Windows drivers, I just downloaded and ran ""Lexmark Printer Software G2 Driver and Software"". I ignored ""Lexmark Printer Software G2 Postscript Driver Package"" since the first one is much larger and includes Postscript support.10. Running it the first time, it couldn't detect the printer, and became unresponsive. I killed the task, then ran it again. Second time it detected the printer immediately.I hope the above was helpful. Maybe printers with newer versions of firmware (mine was 050 something) will be more stable.The printer itself is very heavy. I didn't weigh it, but Lexmark says it weighs 45 lbs and that seems about right. Unpacking it, you need to open up 2 compartments and pull out some straps that stabilize the internal parts during shipping before plugging it in. It looks a bit simple, and the plastic walls seem a bit thin, but frankly it's quite amazing for a color laser printer that costs under $300.The back of the printer has a USB Type B and Ethernet port. No USB or Ethernet cables are supplied so if you want to use one of these ports, you need to provide your own cable. USB Type B is the one with a large-ish square connector typically only used in printers.There's a paper tray and you can adjust it for different paper size. Mine was set just a little too small for Letter, so I was a bit puzzled when I put paper in and it didn't quite fit. Adjusting it is pretty straightforward.Configuring it through the two line LCD is quite tedious. It's much easier doing it through the web interface. One thing that concerns me is that neither the web interface nor the FTP interface has any security, and it's not obvious to me if there's any way to add even a simple password to protect it. Make sure the network you're connecting it to is secure, and it's a good idea to turn it off when you're done printing.Once everything is set up, printing it is very straightforward. I haven't printed many pages through it yet, but so far printing is smooth and fast, and print quality is good. Text is crisp and I look forward to not having to pay for expensive ink cartridges. I'm not sure why the magenta toner shows as 2/3 full before I printed a single page though (see photo).I will keep this review updated based on my experience. I thought I'd get this out first so that the installation tips can help some people.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GZW5YP3DT6VY?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07FDJQR32,16,1,No,

Inkjets tend to dry out and clog in the dry climate so a color laser seemed like a better idea.The printer came with only a graphic sheet to explain how to unpack and install it. I figured out how to use the internal screen and menu system to complete the basic installation. At first this seemed to work well, but the first color hiking map demonstrated very poor color.I downloaded the PDF owners manual to learn how to diagnose the problem. It had extensive troubleshooting information. Both cyan and yellow were poor on the Print Quality test page. The initial recommendation of shaking the toner cartridges made a considerable improvement but the true fix required removing the developer unit and imaging kit also.I was reluctant to go that far, but was stuck. Once that was done, things now appear to work correctly.The printer was then quite fast and I noticed very little smell which is a common complaint with color lasers, including the one I own.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R175TDPIHK60EA?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07FDJQR32,1,0,No,

R1TXY9ZLWLJ9YF,"June 10, 2020",James,5,B3340dw,Verified Purchase,"The Lexmark 3340dw is a fast, no frills laser printer that won't break the bank.","As I write this, we are still very much in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and I suspect that will still be the case come November. Here in The Buckeye State we have to request an absentee ballot by sending an application via USPS. Since I do not intend to go to the polls in person, I chose to replace my worthless, broken, 6 year old Canon inkjet printer so that I could print out the ballot application. The old inkjet actually stopped functioning properly a few years ago, and I had limped along during that time relying on the printers at work for all of my printing needs. However, I am now working from home for the foreseeable future and do not want to don a mask and drive into the office just to pick up a piece of paper.My only requirement: I was determined to have a laser printer. I've had a string of inkjets that all did a number of things, like make copies or scan documents. All of them were doomed to be mediocre at best at any task assigned to them, but the clincher is that they always stopped working after about 3 or 4 years. What's more, they are incredibly slow. The Canon for instance liked to spend about 2 full minutes making a bunch of noises, gears turning, beeps beeping, lights flashing, and that was before it even pulled a sheet of paper out of the tray. Once it finally started printing, it was like watching a JPEG download on dial-up. All that is to say that inkjets suck, and the old Canon has a date with my trusty metal bar a la the dreaded fax machine in the movie Office Space.This printer fit the bill for me. The bulk of my printing needs are things like the aforementioned ballot application, or airline boarding passes. For that reason, I don't really see a need for color unless you are doing graphics or photos. I also have a phone with an excellent camera. It can capably scan a document into PDF form, and I can print that PDF to my hearts content on my new laser printer. For that reason, I also saw no need to have a copier or scanner attached to my printer. This printer does the one thing I need it to do, and it does it fast. How fast, you ask? There is a span of about 1.5 seconds between hitting the print button and retrieving a completed printout from the printer. Perhaps this is average performance for a laser printer? Eh, what do I know? I mainly bought it because it had 5 star reviews and was pretty much the cheapest option.As for installation, I would recommend going to the Lexmark site first and downloading the documentation. The one page installation guide that comes in the box is clearly meant for an international audience (think IKEA), due to it being a series of slightly confusing pictographs that lacked any meaningful text instructions. If you want to print from any computer running windows 10 then you will want to go to the Lexmark site again, and download and install the driver first, presuming of course that you do not have a cd-rom drive to use the included install disk (it is 2020 after all). I tried installing without the installation software on my windows 10 desktop, and it inverted the color so that it printed a black background with white text. Obviously that will use up your toner in a hurry. My Macs on the other hand worked perfectly with AirPrint. Also, get the mobile app to set it up. The on-device interface is where I suspect they cut corners to get the price so low, and the app is faster and easier by far. Once you've done that, you can administer the printer settings via it's web server on a browser, which has no such shortcomings as the on-device interface. Last recommendation, setup security so your wannabe hacker neighbors don't decide to do it for you, and lock you out of your own printer.This printer is my first Lexmark, and it has exceeding my expectations so far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a similar use case to mine. However the jury is still out on the longevity of the device, due to a lack of a sufficient amount of time passing or an ability to divine the future, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TXY9ZLWLJ9YF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY2RMY,25,0,No,

The build quality of the printer feels great without any loose or parts that seem like a slight knock will break it. It warms up much faster than other printers I have used and is pretty quiet.

From my other computers both windows and Mac devices it works fine. Second the mobile set up didn't work for me so I had to connect my printer though a ethernet cable which you need to have on hand.

If not planning to connect to WiFi, connect to a wired network using the Ethernet port, or connect directly with a USB cable. this is an outstanding and reliable printer.

STILL ON THE HUNT...,"UPDATE 3.21.20I went to print on the printer for the second time since printing after set up the first day I opened this printer. I saw the same problem as I did with my previous printer. The print quality is splotchy and blurry. Part of the page didn't even print. I tried darkening the toner in the settings - same issue, no difference. I tried doing a test print - even the test print was splotchy and not clear but the very last page said no issues with cartridge. Amazon customer service said try replacing the toner (which would have cost me HUNDREDS of dollars) which was ridiculous. I am still on the hunt for just a decent printer...I am starting to question if there are any good printers out there any more.I tried another brand before this and was an awful experience printing and trying to return it. I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this. Not enough to send back because the printer is so quick and sharp, but a bit annoyed my colors on the screen won't come out on the page exactly.

R2KF2JGQCYP5DZ,"June 8, 2020",Nielo,2,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Buy something else,"The final edit of how I feel about this printer.BUY SOMETHING ELSE!The printer is barely OK but the toner cartridges, at about $100 each for each color, are phenomenally expensive. The starter cartridges that come with the printer will give you maybe 100 pages after which you'll have to spend almost $400 for replacements that say they're good for 1500 pages. So far I can't find anybody to supply re-manufactured or some other kind of alternate.Everything below this line is my first impression.The pro.I set the printer up connected directly to my computer via USB so I can't comment on other setups. The USB setup was simple, just install the CD and run it.The tiny screen on the printer is adequate for the job.The con.The print quality is a puzzle.I unboxed and removed all the shipping tape and printed a few pages. I was very disappointed and thought I'd have to send the printer back. The problem was the density of the print was very inconsistent with some very light places and some almost ok. It was late and I figured I'd try a few more pages the next day and see if there were some print quality adjustments I could make. I didn't get to the printer until late the next day and, without doing anything, printed a few pages, some just black text and some schematics that contained a few colors. Those prints were very good. So, the puzzle is what changed that allowed the printer to work properly?One other thing is the envelope printing is a little off, at least using Word (2016). When the envelope is printed part of the return address doesn't get printed because it's off the envelope. Moving the address about a half inch in the envelope set-up corrects the problem, but the correction doesn't persist so it needs to be set every time. There may be a more elegant fix, I have to play with it.My conclusion, now that the print quality has gotten better, is I'm pleased with the purchase.Update:When you print a document that is only black the print is lousy. If the page has any color on it the black print, and the color print, is very good.One more update then I'm done:I went to the printer settings and changed the quality/toner darkness from the default ""Use Printer Settings"" to ""Use Toner Darkness"" and printed a page. Actually, I printed 7 pages of all black text. The problem went away. Then, I switched back to the original ""Use Printer Settings"" and printed the same 7 pages again. The problem seems to have gone away with this setting too. My guess is the printer had to calibrate itself.Last but not least, there's a software update I may install. The version that came with the printer is pretty old.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KF2JGQCYP5DZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,

We've had the Lexmark C3224dw for a couple of months now. The price was great, and the print quality is solid (see attached gift card I just printed out). I will say the setup was kind of a pain. But now that its setup, I've had zero issues printing wireless from any of my devices.

R1IMP2SWI3PY7T,"June 7, 2020",US-Gaming reviews,4,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Great for home office use I would not suggest using this for business,"So firstly I want to start off by saying there are a lot of negative reviews on this that are literally unjustified. These are usually problems with the toner cartridge or people fail to properly follow the directions on initial setup. In addition I can vouch that the Wi-Fi on this does work flawlessly with almost every device I've used it on I have yet to test it with Alexa but we'll be doing so after I write a skill set for it. I have enclosed a bunch of photos a picture of the Disney Castle is printed on Plain paper and the other image was printed on photo paper So now onto my review...So in this review I'm going to address three areas the printer quality, the print quality, and the cost of use. First let's start with the overall quality this seems to be like every other laser printer as far as the overall housing internal components seem to be primarily plastic which is normal 4 most printers in its class. It does not come with a USB plug although one can be purchased. It does come with a power cord. The toner tray slides out from the front and the clips that lock the toner in place are made out of plastic so over a long. Of time they could present a problem and possibly break off. I would not say this is a deal-breaker. Does printer stands 9 in tall and is 16 in wide and is approximately 15 and 1/2 in deep. It contains built in Wi-Fi and has a port for ethernet. This has a port for USB but does not contain the USB cord itself. In addition does does have a manual feeder tray which is located in the front and it also has the automatic sheet feed tray which is just under it . You can print small photographs using 4 x 6 in Premium Photo Paper . But I have not tried anything smaller than this as far as paper is concerned . Envelope printing is also excellent and will leave absolutely zero creases in the envelope compared to most other Laser Printers. This comes with for starter toner cartridges which come already in the printer. You must follow the setup directions very closely to avoid damaging the product. This does come with a CD with drivers and software. Now moving on to the print quality compared to some of the competitors this print quality is actually really decent when compared to Samsung HP and brother Laser Printers in its class.. this printer that I received had very limited instructions which I was kind of surprised at. Especially for Lexmark. In my eyes this look like a factory recert where they had printed documentation off of a printer and enclosed it. But none the less was very easy to set up and all of the user manuals and Owner Manuals can be downloaded directly from Lexmark website. Moving on to the value I only gave this three stars for a couple of reasons first the product as compared to others of its class is very cheap I think I paid approximately $140 for this whereas most printers in this class range about $200 or more so that in itself is a great deal moving on to the second reason after doing an ample amount of research I have found that the toner cartridges are quite expensive to replace. For a refill directly from Lexmark it cost approximately $70 per cartridge. Other sites I have found the refill toner cartridges to be anywhere from $200 per set, up to literally almost $400 for the set of cartridges. in addition to this if you have the knowledge to do so you can purchase a toner refill kit. I have found the cheapest price to be approximately $70 this includes all four colors however the caveat is there is no toner reset chip available at this time. Although several reviews for toner refill on this specific printer have all said that it will let you print even after the chip is considered depleted I feel you must research it yourself once the toner chips are made available they are very easy to replace and you could reuse your toner cartridges for a long time. On that note I would say for a general home office printer this is a very good purchase if you are planning on purchasing this for business use I would suggest not going with this printer and going with a brother as the toner cartridges and chips are much cheaper and they have been in business far longer than Lexmark and their parts are made with much higher quality with businesses in mind.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IMP2SWI3PY7T?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,1,0,No,

The experience is not acceptable. The shipped with cartridges should allow you to print up to 500 pages for color and 750 pages for black. We value our customers and would like to investigate the possible cause of the print quality, as well as the toner not even getting close to the declared page yield.

The next day, I went through all the steps again for more than an hour, requiring a call back again.

So here we go again. After several hours and another call back, the tech person was talking to another tech person. Just as the additional tech person was getting remote access to my laptop, he decided to take a 10 minute break! This was my breaking point. I STILL continued to work with them, and you know what?

R1BNI07WOQLRRM,"July 18, 2019",frequentshopper,3,MB2442adwe,Verified Purchase,Problems After One Year - Will Be Discontinued in 2020,"I purchased the MX417DE on May 3, 2018. It worked great. I work from home as an Adjunct Professor. I am also a doctoral student. I print a lot. My in-box toner lasted for approximately 8 months. I purchased another toner in January, 2019. Last week (the week of July 8th), my printer began to print faded pages as if the toner was low. However, the diagnostics indicated that I had 80% toner remaining. I contacted Lexmark. They indicated it was a Toner problem. So, I purchased a new toner directly from Lexmark for $240.00. The toner was not the problem. So, they indicated it was the Transfer Roller. I purchased that for $25+. That was not the problem. Since my Lexmark warranty was expired, I contacted Square Trade (An Allstate Company) who held my extended warranty. They determined it was a hardware problem (after one year of having the printer). They offered me a cash-out or a replacement printer. I chose the cash out (5 to 7 business days). I contacted Lexmark to order a replacement. I was informed that if I contacted presales, I could get 30% off a new printer to help mitigate some of the cost because the cost of the printer had gone up since I purchased it. When I contacted presales, they informed me that the MX models would be discontinued next year and therefore, I could only purchase them directly from a dealer (without the 30% discount). That irritated me. They offered me a different model which was double the price of the previous printer. Plus, it was not compatible with the toner (80% full) that I already have, which means that I will lose all of that toner. They are going to refund my new toner purchase plus the transfer roller purchase. However, I will have to eat the 80% remaining toner that I will not be able to use unless I go to a dealer to have them repair the printer, possibly costing more than the value of the printer, given that the warranty is gone and the model will be discontinued next year. With the exception of one customer service person, all seven of the other Lexmark staff in orders, presales, parts, and tech support were either incompetent or rude. Dana at Lexmark was great. Allison was okay as well. Of course, she only transferred me back to Dana. Everyone else needs additional training or a new job. This was the worst week in customer service incompetence I have ever experienced. And I have experienced a lot of bad customer service. Believe me! Plus, I will be upside down $300.00 even after the refunds and discounts. Go figure! Just know that if you are thinking about purchasing any Lexmark MX models, they will soon be discontinued. Also, many of the Lexmark customer service people are either incompetent or rude. I would take a rude competent person if I had to choose. But incompetence is not something that I can tolerate (Heavy sigh)! If the MX models are experiencing hardware problems after one year, then perhaps it is better that they be discontinued. So, the replacement model that I ordered, which has not yet arrived is MB2546ADWE. Just FYI! I hope this helps, despite the rant.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BNI07WOQLRRM?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F22K2LS,29,0,No,

R34FYK4HWXY897,"December 7, 2018",Fbx_Steve,5,MB2442adwe,Unverified,Very capable office printer!,"The Lexmark MB2442adwe is a great choice for a small office or a workgroup. It is a monochrome printer, so it might not be the best choice for a home printer. However, if you are satisfied that you don't need/want to print color at home, it would make a great home machine too. It feels very sturdy and well-made.This all-in-one prints at up to 42ppm, and is rated for a monthly print volume of up to 10,000 pages, so it should be up to the demands of most small offices. In testing, it reached (or at least came pretty close) to the 42ppm. I had no desire to burn through 20 or so reams of paper though, so I can't vouch for the monthly volume rating. Print quality was outstanding and it presented no problems using AirPrint from an iPhone or iPad. Setup was a breeze (with Macs, anyway; we don't have any Windows PCs), both wireless and using Ethernet. The instructions are clear and relatively concise. The MB2442adwe prints its first page quickly, too, usually spitting out the first page 7-8 seconds after hitting, ""print.""It has a couple of features that are very helpful in an office environment. The first is the ability to print securely. If you select this option in the print job dialog, your job won't print until you go to the printer and enter a PIN you selected when printing. This is very useful to ensure that sensivive documents don't print until you are physically at the printer waiting for them. The second is the ability to add an additional, 550-page capacity, input tray. The built-in tray holds 250 sheets, plus there is the usual multi-purpose feeder (which in the MB2442adwe holds 100 pages, more than these typically can handle). The addition of an extra input tray can either give you access to an additional paper size/type, or just add extra capacity of a single size so you don't have to refill as often.There are a couple of things that are less than optimal, however. The first is this cryptic note in the ""Specs"" section on the Lexmark website: ""Product functions only with replacement cartridges designed for use in a specific geographical region."" This appears to mean that replacement cartridges are locked to a specific region, sort of like DVDs; I've personally never heard of this and am just speculating. That may or may not be an issue, but is something you should be aware of.The second is that, while the printer is well-suited for a moderate to heavy burden of office printing, the scanner and copier are not if you are scanning or copying duplex documents. It scans duplex, to be sure. However, it does this by way of RADF (Reversing Automatic Document Feeder). This means that it scans one side of the page, ejects that page not quite all the way, then re-feeds it to scan the other side. Essentially, it takes twice as long to scan a 2-sided document as it does a single-sided one. The ideal scanners and copiers have true Duplex Automatic Document Feeders (DADF), with two scanning elements so that both sides of the page are scanned during a single pass. This is not an issue unless you have a heavy scanning or copying volume, AND a great percentage of that volume consists of documents printed on both sides. The ADF holds 50 pages, more than most printers intended for home use, which is consistent with its office-focused design.The price of this printer is quite reasonable for the quality and capacity you get in the printing area, so it stands to reason money would have to be saved somewhere, and it was in the scanning/copying functions. That being said, the scanner is plenty fast, so you may very well find this to be a non-issue. However, it is something else you should be aware of.The all-in-one also sends and receives faxes, but I don't have a landline, so I couldn't test either.Overall, this is a great printer, especially for the price. I would have no hesitation to use it in my office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34FYK4HWXY897?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F22K2LS,9,0,No,

The setup wizard makes this very easy to set up using an iPhone. Our family has 4 iPhones, 5 iPads, and 2 iPod touches, AirPrint is a critical component for us. Our previous printer is the Ricoh in the second photo. It prints nice quality for cheap, but it’s miserable to use with apple devices.This Lexmark is a perfect and seamless component in our home apple ecosystem. There is one small trick, make sure your device is on the same WiFi network as the printer, otherwise no available printer will show up in your printer options. We have Fios by Frontier, and they provide a wireless router, but we have a much better Orbi home network we use. So with two different WiFi options, it can get a little confusing, because your device may auto select either network, but your printer will only use the network you chose on setup. If you have problems with AirPrint, check your WiFi settings.This Lexmark is much quieter than the outgoing Ricoh, and has a much smaller power draw. It warms up much faster, and prints much faster. Our old Ricoh would dim the lights during its 50 second warm up cycle, this Lexmark barely makes a sound, and completes warm up in well under 10 seconds. So if power draw on an overloaded circuit, or noise, are factors for you, you’ll appreciate this as much as I do.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JTVS3UYL34Z8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F22K2LS,7,0,No,

R37KQUV906QNAO,"December 12, 2018",Fbx_Steve,3,MB2338adw,Vine Customer,"Good economy printer for office, but with limitations","The MB2338adw is a good choice for a small office or a workgroup where up-front cost is important and your needs are mainly for printing only. It prints a more-than-adequate 36ppm. It has an automatic document feeder (ADF). However, the ADF is not a duplex scanner. It does print duplex automatically, however. If you are scanning or copying 2-sided documents, you will have to scan one side, then turn it over and scan the other side. Not practical for anything other than occasional use. Essentially, the MB2338adw is positioned as a budget alternative to the more full-featured MB2442adwe, with a slightly slower print speed (36ppm vs 40), lower recommended monthly duty cycle rating (6,000 pages vs. 10,000), no secure print capability, and the lack of a duplex ADF being the primary differences. However, for an average price difference of only around $40, I'm not sure the tradeoffs are worth the modest price reduction.It is a monochrome printer, so it might not be the best choice for a home printer. However, if you are satisfied that you don't need/want to print color at home, it would work at home too.

Twice as high as most of them, and 1 1/2 times our biggest. It can sit on a table, but I wouldn't put it on a desk I'm working at. I'd call it ""manageable"" size. We have it under a desk in a spare room so tucked out of sight. But if the desk was ever used, it'd be tough to find a place to put it where it wasn't at the least highly noticeable and at worst obtrusive. We might have cleared out some floor space in a closet I'm guessing. It certainly doesn't ""blend in"", but it's not massive or hulking.UseIt was immediately recognized by all our sundry devices on the network--phones, laptops, tablets, desktops (all Apple products) and printed from all easilyPrinting is super fast. I actually thought when the first sheet came out ""Oh man, what went wrong"" because it never crossed my mind it had actually printed a two-sided full-text document that quickly. We've had all inkjet in our house, so don't know if this is due to this particular machine or laser printers in general, but it certainly was a speed jump compared to our inkjet (which aren't ancient--the most recent is only a few months old)Text was clear, dark, and preciseGood amount of papergenerally cheaper than inkjet based on design. We'll have to wait a while to update this on how long the the ink lasts in this particular deviceQuietWe'll use this as our ""beast of burden"" for text and major printing/copying (two teachers in the house) and reserve the inkjets for pictures/illustrations and for those times we're lazy and want to print just where we are sittingSo far we really like this save for the few blips on setting it up.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZYTILBCW6PEP?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F21DSM8,1,0,No,

R2RAWFZA00JSM3,"November 29, 2018",S. Beck,5,MB2338adw,Vine Customer,LOVE laser printers,"Easiest set up for me thought I've been using different makes of laser printers so I'm a bit familiar.No more dried up ink cartridges every time you need to print. The toner cartridge will last the average household at least a year and it's not going to be dry 2 months from now when you need a printed paper! Most have gotten away from printed filing but, if you do, then laser printers are great and I've always been a fan of Lexmark.Years ago laser printers were for 'big' businesses only due to pricing. Now they're affordable and they are available in color print too. I have found that color really isn't needed for anything we do in our business or house. If I have something that needs color, I upload it and have it printed at an online site or take it on a thumb drive to a local store to print. IF you need any type of printing in your home or office - laser printing is the best in my opinion.Can you tell I absolutely LOVE laser printers?! I have an office in my home for business and I need a printer. Every time I needed to use the old ink jets - the ink would be dry and not print correctly. Then I'd have to go through the print head cleans and thate whole big, waste of time, thing. If this toner print seems to be getting light, I remove the cartridge and tip it back and forth to move the powder toner around and it will be fine (this only happens when it's getting to the end.)I do a lot of printing and I only use one cartridge a year, sometimes I start a second with a month or so remaining.There's only one issue if you're printing labels and that is mentioned in the 'cons' below.In short - the pros -*Toner Cartridge will last and last with no ink to dry up.Saves money over time and no aggravation with dried up ink 2 months from now.*Wireless*Can scan, fax and copythe cons ---* it's a bigger footprint than the compact 'print only' options.*toner cartridges are pricey (but not in comparison to ink and shelf life)*black printing only on this particular monotone model*inside does run hot*i found that some labels will get 'stuck' more than others and a jam can sometimes be 'tricky' with the hot parts.it doesn't happen often though - not often enough for me to even consider going back to ink cartridges!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RAWFZA00JSM3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07F21DSM8,3,0,No,

I haven't tried scanning photos yet. Here's the good, the bad and the ugly. The copier (fairly large...more like an office printer) came with a one page (front & back) photo/symbol instruction sheet with no verbiage. I discovered 2 slightly different user guides on the web...the major difference being the connector panel configuration in the rear. Using and de-cyphering the no language, symbols only sheet, I removed all the tape (way more than the four shown on the sheet) and removed the 2 cartridges, rotated them 3X and then reinserted. I was accustomed to pulling a plastic film/tab on other cartridges; Lexmark doesn't use them but they did have a complex plastic harness on one, for want of a better description. The single, non verbiage sheet then clearly shows NOT CONNECTING the MX317 to the computer....this is INCORRECT; I assume the sheet is referring to Lexmark's other model, which is wireless and more expensive. You will need to purchase a USB (a) to USB (b) cable (search Amazon ""USB to printer cable"") and connect the printer to the PC. The instructions show connecting the printer cable (to a router) which won't work since this is the (cheaper) printer connected to a PC model; then the sheet instructs you to turn the printer on (step 14) and lastly inserting the enclosed CD (step 15). I assumed the CD loaded the print driver; which it does,.....BUT...it also contains the step by step instructions (30+ pages or so) in English so....INSERT the disk FIRST and follow these CD instructions...which contradict the single page hieroglyphics sheet. The CD instructs the user to NOT connect the printer cable until the last step. So...to summarize...insert the disk into your PC and follow or print out the CD's instructions. ignore the single sheet hieroglyphics unless you can't read English ..unpack and set up the printer/copier....connect the printer to your PC using a USB to printer (""A"" to ""B"" USB) cable which you must purchase, and follow the setup/programming instructions on the CD disk.... You will also have to program the copier/printer using its ""console"" buttons (select language, time zone, functionality....FTP = file transfer protocol which I don't recommend: if you choose FAX...you'll need to input (and have connected) a land line telephone number.

Previous multifunction fax printer was having issues and despite it being less than nine months old (it was a canon), we had had enough and we’re looking for replacement. Years ago I owned a Lexmark printer. It served me very well, was a workhorse, and I honestly had no complaints and could not have been happier with it. When I was initially looking at this printer I was a bit hesitant. For starters, it being so heavily discounted gave me pause. I was concerned that perhaps people had experienced issues with this model and The remaining stock was being liquidated. I could not have been more wrong. After its initial set up, this machine has been the best fax/printer that we have ever had. It prints quickly with sharp text and images, spools quickly, and has a very speedy fax modem. The fact of the matter is, you won’t find a better deal on an enterprise grade machine that works so well and is so reliable. I will say that, as others have said, if you’re going to use this machine on a local network it would be important to have technical skills. I’m not using it for that purpose since I only connected to one computer. But there are apps available that allow you to print wirelessly via whatever computer you have connected to this printer or any other for that matter. It really is built like a tank. I’m pretty sure this thing could take take a couple of bullets and keep on printing. Just be aware that this is a machine intended for an enterprise environment. That’s not to say that it couldn’t be used in a home office or a small business. Just be aware that this is not a $100 inkjet that you could pick up at Best Buy. The network settings menu is for the technically inclined. With that being said, I am by no means a network engineer. I know how to set up basic Wi-Fi networks in my home and little more. When I received this MFC, I opened the enormous box and plugged in the power, tel, and USB cables and called it a day. If you do not intend to use this on a network, just know that it most definitely can be used in that way and if you do you have the know-how to establish this device on the network you can do that as well. We really have been so impressed by this machine. Lexmark can make a heck of a printer.
