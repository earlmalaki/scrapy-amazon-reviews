No,"I was nervous getting this printer due to other reviews of it being extremely difficult to set up to WiFi, I even purchased a direct chord for it just in case.

No,"So before you buy this printer let me tell you about my issues i had. First i had plugged it in follow the pictures that were given for instructions. (Note: there is no words for the instructions) After i had done so i downloaded the app that it told me to however in the Google play store i did not download the Lexmark printer assistant app which i needed to set it up. I had downloaded the Lexmark print app which was not of help since the printer was not even connected to my WiFi at this point. It took me a good 2 hours just to figure that part out. Then after getting the printer on the WiFi network and all set up on the phone i go to set up on the computer. I have an HP running windows 10 home edition. It took me 4 hours just to get the drivers installed onto the computer and for it to recognized that i had a printer on the WiFi network. I can get test page to print just fine however what i had printed for an actual test print did not print it said error printer offline. The printer clearly says on the little 2 line screen ""Ready"". I started this task at 10:30 am Arizona time it is now 9:33 pm and what i had sent to the printer as a test print is now being printed on its own without my computer being on.

Yes,"I took a chance and got this printer based on the positive Amazon Vine reviews. The set up was a breeze, even using just the control panel and not the app. However, I tried printing a 20-page PDF that has a file size of 5mb. The printer could not process the PDF and would only print a single page and give me an error saying that the memory is full. So then I tried to just print two pages from the PDF, and it can't even handle that. If it can't print a multi-page document it is pretty worthless. And there is no way you can print 24 pages a minute if you have to print them one page at a time. If you just want to print a single page all the time, than this printer would be great for you, and the print quality was good. But if you need to print a multi-page document... you'll want to look somewhere else. Needless to say, I will be returning this and buying another HP or Brother printer.Update #1 - I spent a whole day trying to get this printer to work. I reinstalled it multiple times, restored factory settings, reset it up, updated the printer firmware, updated my operating system, and then finally figured out that if I installed it using generic post script printing and boom! it works.

No,"=== My Take ===The Lexmark C3224dw is my first ever color laser printer and I like it very much for the most part. I like its compact and space-saving design and dimensions despite its heavier than expected heft. The control panel screen is bright & clear and the buttons around it are very responsive to my inputs. It is very intuitive to operate even without consulting the user manual first.I also liked its print quality - both in color and black & white. Text and images came out clear and smudge-free and the printing speed was satisfactory. Print operations were quiet, even the warm-up routine. Intermittently, however, the printer took an unusually long time to wake up from its Sleep & Hibernate status. There were times when we waited for longer than 30 seconds before the printer began flashing its light & started to print. Once it got warmed up, though, all later printer jobs printed at normal and satisfactory speeds.Another strong point for the C3224dw is its fast and simple setup process. I added it to my home network using just the control panel buttons to select my home WiFi and typing in the password. This process was seamless and very smooth. I also connected the printer to my desktop via a USB Type B cable (not included in the box) and installed the printer by installing the driver package from the Lexmark website. You also have the option to set it up using an Ethernet cable (also not included).Despite easily adding the printer to my home WiFi, however, none of my Windows 10 laptops around the house could find the printer during an actual print job, such as from Microsoft Word and Chrome browser. My wifey, who is not very techy, got frustrated because the printer wasn't listed in the printer selection drop-down menu. I had to go to Settings in Windows 10 and add the printer manually by typing in its IP address on each of my laptops. Compared to my other printers from Brother and HP, this part of my printing experience was subpar and disappointing. I expected a big printer company such as Lexmark to do a better job integrating the C3224dw to Windows 10.Another surprising thing was that there was no Windows 10 Lexmark app for the C3224dw printer. In order to access its settings, I had to launch the Embedded Web Server by opening a browser such as Chrome and then typing in its IP address. I guess some people might prefer this approach because it is one less app you have to install but I wouldn't have minded a Windows 10 app. You can install the Lexmark phone app but I chose not to do so because I have too many apps installed already on my Galaxy S10+ (>200).Once you access the printer settings via the Embedded Web Server, things are pretty straightforward and easy to navigate within. There are two main settings categories - Status & Settings. Under Status, you can view any Alerts & Warnings messages, Supply/Toner status, and printer info (firmware version, paper bin status).Under Settings, there are six additional sub-categories: Device, Print, Paper, Network/Ports, Security, and Reports.Under the Device section, I found the following options to be useful for our home - setting up low printer supply email notifications, configuring Sleep & Hibernate timeouts, turning on Eco Mode, and performing a firmware update.Inside the Print section, I turned on Duplex printing & the Collate option and set image printing to ""Auto Fit.""Inside the Network/Ports section, I left alone all the numerous options at their default (Wireless, AirPrint, Ethernet, TCP/IP, SNMP, IPSec, 802.1x, LPD, HTTP/FTP, USB, Restrict external network access, WiFi Direct) but did activate Google Cloud Print.I also left everything at default in the Security sub-section.Although the Settings page is plain and simple-looking, navigation among the options was quick, responsive, and very satisfactory and I appreciated all options given to me.All in all, I'm happy & satisfied with the Lexmark C3224dw and I don't regret getting it. Hopefully future firmware updates will improve printer wakeup time from its Sleep/Hibernate status._____*Pros:-Easy setup (WiFi or USB Type B).-Control panel buttons are responsive and intuitive to use.-Both color and black & white prints come out nice and clear.-Compact footprint.-Quiet operation.-Supports Lexmark Mobile Print, Google Cloud Print, Mopria Print, Apple AirPrint, and Wifi Direct.-Settings page offer numerous fine-tuning, network, and security options._____*Neutral:-Pretty heavy~!!-Wake-up time from Sleep is longer than I prefer.-Printer didn't get auto-detected by Windows 10 on all of my laptops on my home network. I had to add it manually by entering its IP address.-Performing a firmware update over the Embedded Web Server isn't as easy & simple as doing it with a Windows 10 or smartphone app.-Cartridge replacements will cost around $300 for all four._____*Cons:-Once in a while, print jobs over WiFi took TOO long.

No,"I am using this to replace a Brother laser printer (NO COLOR, NO WIFI) that I have used for 6 years and it was still going strong.So far I don‚Äôt regret the upgrade to this Lexmark.

I opted to go to mobile app route since I'd be connecting to my wi-fi network and entering a password on the printer's minimalist screen would be a pain.On the mobile app, you'll be prompted to connect to a wi-fi signal being output by the printer, and from there you'll tell it what wi-fi network you want IT to connect to, along with the password, and you're set!...or rather...you should be. For me, everything appeared to be setup just fine, but for some reason, I still had to manually select a network and enter the password on the printer itself. Not really sure what went wrong, but that was a little annoying. Once connected, simply install the printer's driver software from the included disc (or download from Lexmark site) and you should be set.Besides that minor inconvenience, printing quality is perfect, and fast. It goes to sleep automatically after a period of not being used, and it doesn't make any noise or mechanical adjustments when being turned on/off, or when sleeping, or being woken. Other printers I've had all seem to make noise when doing this and this sometimes occurred in the middle of the night too, so it'd be a bit startling, but this Lexmark is perfectly quiet in this respect.Overall, really nice printer that does its job well.",Bluering,0,"July 29, 2019",R31BL20KZA0QSQ,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Vine Customer,,5,A little clunky setup at first but great quality prints,3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BL20KZA0QSQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,Ugh
No,"Below are my thoughts/observations on the Lexmark C3224dw Color Laser Printer. Some pictures are also included.Setup- the printer box had illustrations on top showing how to remove the printer from the box. I found that helpful and accurate in how best to begin the setup process.- Inside, a two sided sheet showed additional instructions for removing the tape, setting up the toner cartridges (which were already installed) and adding paper- It came with an installation CD for use in setting the printer up as locally attached to a PC. - You will need to supply your own USB printer cord and connect it to the printer and PC. - Turn on the printer; load the CD in your computer‚Äôs drive and the install process will begin automatically (I installed it on a Windows 10 desktop). In a couple of minutes, my PC sent a pop-up message that it was done.- While the CD was installing the printer drivers, etc. to my PC, the printer itself also displayed messages on its display screen: - First, it asked if I wanted to setup the phone app. I declined this since I did not want another phone app. - Next, it walked me through the steps to set it up on my home WIFI. This was pretty easy to do but unavoidably repetitive. I.e., if your WIFI name is ‚ÄúKatManDu-74‚Äù, you will have to enter each upper/lowercase letter, character or number by repeatedly pressing an arrow key for each one then hitting ‚ÄúOK‚Äù. Not difficult to do but boring. This, of course, took longer to complete than the automated process with the CD.Output QualtiyIt is excellent. I printed multiple photographs and they looked great and also printed some test prints and plain text documents that also looked really good.Printing Through WIFIWithout installing any apps to my iPhone or iPad, I was able to print multiple photos even though the WIF router was upstairs and I was in the basement sitting next to the printer. This means the image was transmitted through the floor/walls to the router and back through the floor/walls to the printer without issue.Overall ImpressionsAs stated earlier, I did not install or test any Lexmark printing apps (for the phone or PC) but do not think they are needed for wireless/remote printing. They may have other features (low toner warnings, etc.) that you may desire so, that is a choice you must make..It is quiet, and gives excellent quality output whether locally attached to your PC or sitting as a standalone device on your WIFI. You also have the option of connecting it to your network using an Ethernet cable but I did not test that since making the WIFI connection was so simple.I am very happy with the Lexmark C224DW printer.",Bluering,0,"July 28, 2019",RYLHERBWWYBU8,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Vine Customer,,5,Excellent Output; Easy Local or WIFI Setup,19,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYLHERBWWYBU8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,MWCraft

No,"Almost didn't buy this based on all the 1-Star reviews, but realized they were mostly wireless connectivity issues. Having printers drop wireless connections is a Home WiFi given and is easily corrected by assigning an IP address to your printers.

No,"¬†The Good:-Compact design (fits in the same space as my older smaller inkjet printer)-Great print quality-Fast printing-Easy set up (just have to download the Lexmark iOS app)-Fairly quiet operationThe Bad:-No scanning functionality (but compact design), I typically scan with my phone anyways and just print from my phoneThe Bottom Line:We are using this as our primary printer in the house and it‚Äôs great since now we don‚Äôt have to worry about our inkjet constantly drying up. The print quality is superb and it prints double sided to save paper. The printer prints fairly quietly and quickly. The best part of this color laser printer is it‚Äôs compact design. It fits in the same spot as our smaller inkjet printer. The set up was very easy as you just download the Lexmark iOS app (I use an iPhone 8 Plus) and then you just connect to your WiFi and you‚Äôre basically set up and ready for printing.

First, I was shocked at how compact this Lexmark printer is and was so surprised at the same time how powerful and fast it was, this thing is a workhorse. Specially I can send anything via WIFI and no more of running cables and tripping over them.Setup was very easy. From unpacking it, to printing my first page was about 5-10 minutes. I was also surprised at how fast it prints. The print quality was sharp, bold and clear. My only struggle was when I tried to switch from plain paper to labels, the label paper is slick on the back side and the first two sheets I tried did not want to get picked up by the coil. So, I had to take out the labels and air the sheets. What I‚Äôve noticed is that It really helps if you keep the tray full.

Out of the box the printer was printing a series of dots lined vertically 1/2 inch from the right edge, spaced exactly one inch apart on every page. I called Lexmark support who quickly had me run printer diagnostics (again, from the printer display panel). He determined that the problem was caused by the black toner cartridge. He shipped me a new cartridge (full size, not the starter one!), which solved the problem. While it was disappointing to have a problem like this on a brand new printer, Lexmark made up for it.

No,"3 Month Update: I have run low on toner and just discovered there is no aftermarket/generic toners available. I can buy Lexmark high yield toner package for $350 or standard yield for $275. I think I will throw this printer in the garbage and buy something new. I cannot afford toner that expensive, I had just assumed there is always an aftermarket of generic toners, but this printer must not sell in high enough numbers for aftermarket companies to make toners. It will be cheaper for me to throw this away and buy another brand printer that does have aftermarket toners available.Original Review: Home printers are throw away items. They usually don't last more a year, if they do, they need new rollers, drums, etc that cost more than a new printer. My Canon Imageclass MF634cdw was flawless for one year. Got it loaded and up and running in 20 minutes. After one year it started making awful grinding noises and printing badly, etc. Time for something new.This was only $114 and has the auto duplex function. It lacks the all-in-one document feeder and scanner, but I can still use that on my old Imageclass. Setup was difficult (much harder than my Canon was), and the printer could not be detected on my wifi, so I had to google how to load a print driver using an IP address. I've never done this before. Took me about 5 hours to set this printer up on my 2 computers (desktop & laptop), but it prints quickly and quietly. Auto duplex works perfect. After 5 days, it has not gone offline, not had any paper jams, no issues at all.I will update this if I have any issues, but after 5 days, despite some annoyances in getting it up and running, I am very please for only $114.",Bluering,0,"December 10, 2019",RVJ0L3I075N0B,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Verified Purchase,,1,No Aftermarket Toner!!,6,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVJ0L3I075N0B?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,E.

Yes,"I'm terribly disappointed with what this printer has produced. My heart sank on the first test page when what came out appeared to have been the product of an inkjet printer. I really thought I had mistakenly paid for an inkjet the quality is so poor. And now I've gone from feeling like a sucker to being completely furious.I causes me to reconsider that value of Amazon exspecially for more expensive items. I very much wanted to make use of this printer today. I don't get much time off. I don't have time for BS.If I had gotten this at a brink-and-morter, I could solve this problem today. I'd go back to the store, show them the garbage that came out of this printer and they'd likely help me. I'd get back home and could continue with today's work.Instead now I've got to go through the pain of trying to figure out exactly what hoops I've got to jump through to get satisfaction.It's possible that it's not the printer itself that's the problem but instead the toner cartridges it came with. That doesn't matter and it doesn't help me. I need a working device now. I don't have it. I've tried shaking the cartidges but it doesn't help.I've included a video showing what the printer produced.

No,Printer purchased for $118. Great deal right? Wait till you have to buy toner for it. At around $75 each it will cost you $300 to put ink in this printer. Ha!I am updating my review on this printer after over a month of use. At first I was very concerned over the cost of the cartridges. After using it for a while now I am extremely concerned over the cost of the cartridges and the actual pages you get per cartridge.I am printing shipping labels with this printer in black and white. I got about 170 lables with the partial cartridge that it comes with. Today I ordered the third black cartridge from Lexmark. According to the printer count I have printed a total of 766 pages and have used up the starter cartridge and one of the brand new full cartridges. This is an absolutely miserable page count considering Lexmark claims I should be getting 1500+ pages per cartridge.The only reason I went with this printer was because I used to run a Lexmark 250DN printer here in the office. We got well over 1000 pages on each cartridge with that old printer. Guess newer isn't always better.

No,"This thing makes me feel dumb that I never bought one years ago and why this is not considered more on top printer lists as an economy buy. I've wasted so much money on bad inkjet printers that clog over time not to mention all the ink cartridges. I run a small business and need a printer only sporadically for invoicing and bulk photo printing. The review...1. The setup was not without it's challenges. You just need to make sure that you connect the Wifi to the printer first through the printer control panel then proceed with downloading the appropriate drivers/apps for your device. I found it really easy to connect the devices actually. My Google phone and Chromebook latched on immediately. I could see how others could have issues figuring this out though. I'm fairly tech savvy but it still took me a few minutes of fiddling. I don't understand the lack of included instructions out of the box or online. You really just need a small note card that could walk you through it but nothing, weird. The printing software is nothing to write home about and typically no frills.2. Quality for text is very good of course since it's a laser. Photos are okay. They aren't as poppy or crisp as most inkjets in the same price range but it's passable, at least for my needs. I didn't expect too much for the photo printing (due to reviews I read) but it actually met or exceeded my expectations. If photos are your main interest then you shouldn't be looking at a laser anyway.3. Although this is compact compared to other laser printers, it's not exactly small. It takes up as much space as a small multifunction inkjet. The advantage is that I can shove this unit into a shelf because it doesn't have a scanner top that you need to lift. I realized over time that I use a scanner maybe once a year so I wanted forgo that function.Initially, I am super happy with this. The price is amazing!! It does exactly what I need it to do for use as a basic office printer. I've been buying inkjets all my life. I hope that I don't have to deal with clogged printer heads ever again. I was also weary of buying a 'Lexmark' since there is very little hype about this brand. But I love the no frills design and function of this unit.

No,"UPDATE 3.21.20I went to print on the printer for the second time since printing after set up the first day I opened this printer. I saw the same problem as I did with my previous printer. The print quality is splotchy and blurry. Part of the page didn't even print. I tried darkening the toner in the settings - same issue, no difference. I tried doing a test print - even the test print was splotchy and not clear but the very last page said no issues with cartridge. Amazon customer service said try replacing the toner (which would have cost me HUNDREDS of dollars) which was ridiculous. I am still on the hunt for just a decent printer...I am starting to question if there are any good printers out there any more.I tried another brand before this and was an awful experience printing and trying to return it. I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this.

For the price I wasn't expecting much, but this printer just isn't fit for any use. I got about five weeks of printing b&w documents out of it at a rate of 5-10 pages per day, 5 days per week. Very disappointing, and a waste of time, money and energy.",Bluering,1,"March 2, 2020",R3HKMNDZ0EAS3X,C3224dw,Bluering/Lionfish (BRLF),Verified Purchase,"Hi CJ, Thank you for this review.

No,"So far this has been an excellent printer. It does have a little troubled duplexing card stock, but at this price point I'll manually flip the page over.

No,Wonderful upgrade from our (very) old printer and just what we needed.

Yes,"Arrives with the message ""Waste Toner bottle nearly full"". First time I turned it on- out of the box.

One possibility is that during the shipping and handling of your unit, some of the toner got to the sensor that detects a full waste toner bottle. If so, this could be fixed by simply removing the waste bottle and tapping it on a hard surface.  If this isn't successful, we can have a replacement bottle shipped to you, simply call 1-800-LEXMARK Monday-Friday, 8:00am to 9:00pm EST (option 1) and we will take care of you.¬†",4,Great printer...but,0,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R146RCI4ZZZBPA?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,D.

Yes,"Worked great for like a month, now even though it says it is connected, it is only ever 'unreachable'. I've gone in and set up the connection over and over again. It's like any time I want to print ANYTHING I have to reset to factory settings, reconnect, and print immediately. Wait for more than an hour and it's unreachable with no way to connect unless you go back to factory settings and do everything all over again.
