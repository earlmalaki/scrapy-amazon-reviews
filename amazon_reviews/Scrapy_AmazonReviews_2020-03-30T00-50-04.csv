I've gone in and set up the connection over and over again. It's like any time I want to print ANYTHING I have to reset to factory settings, reconnect, and print immediately. Wait for more than an hour and it's unreachable with no way to connect unless you go back to factory settings and do everything all over again. Garbage."

What good is a printer that prints excellent pictures but constantly disconnects from your devices when you need it?! It was constantly offline. I decided to return and go with a more reliable Canon."

It was fast and reliable and while it was very loud when printing, it was silent at all other times. After 5 months of light usage it started printing repeated fat lines of black, magenta, blue, and yellow on every page. It looks more like printing than toner smearing. I tried to contact customer support but there are a lot of roadblocks to getting to an actual person and I don't have time to step through all the hoops so I'm writing it off and buying another brand."

I am so disappointed. Beyond that, I would also add that after yet another 2 hour telephone call to Lexmark yesterday, I have yet to receive the promised return communication from a more advanced tech. Lexmark? Really? You can do better. If there were lemon laws for printers, this one would definitely qualify as a lemon."

We are incredibly pleased with it. Since it arrived and we set it up--which was simple for my husband but he is an IT guy so consider that--we've used it a ton. Probably a good two reams of paper and we've been satisfied with it all.It is an incredibly quick printer and scanner. The print quality is great and the ink never bleeds. I've enjoyed using this printer with my crafts, specifically my waterslide decals, because the laser ink doesn't need to be sealed and doesn't bleed under moisture. It dries quickly and applies precisely.Scanning setup took a bit more effort for me (husband wasn't home) but I got it up and running just fine by myself. The menu is color and so far has worked well, I have no problem operating this printer at all. My multiple devices have paired with it great.As far as laser printers go, and this one also being a color printer, this is an excellent choice for a home or small business printer! I would absolutely recommend it without reservations at this point. Of course, if anything changes I'll update this review accordingly."

To keep my last printer going (kind of - with murky prints) I had to replace a maintenance box twice, so the costs were adding up.At the time of writing this, it looks like there is a black toner cartridge return program that costs $85 for the black toner, making the black replacement a little less than 1/2 the cost of the printer itself - so it might just be cheaper to purchase an all-new printer when this one runs out of toner, or at least two colors."

No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem. The printer has a noise level when printing (and did quiet when not) however, its not much different from the Brother laser printer it replaced and is less noisy than an ink jet.

I’m on macOS and I was wary of a few negative reviews about the lack of Apple software for this unit, but I have a friend who is a Lexmark dealer and authorized repair center, so I thought it was worth the risk.It’s true that there is no Mac driver for this unit, but you don’t need it. Unpacking and setting up was easy… And using the free Lexmark iOS app to set up my Wi-Fi connection couldn’t have been simpler. My Mac Pro saw the printer instantly and I was up and running in two minutes.And while there is no Lexmark software to run this printer… I already owned VueScan, A third-party scanning software… And it runs this printer perfectly, including all of the options for resolution, flatbed scanning, document feeder scanning, and everything else. You can also access all of the printers options through your web browser by locating the printers address on your home network.So… Absolutely a joy to set up and use with my Mac Pro running Mojave."

Those days are long gone and I don't miss them. I plugged this in. Connected it to my wife's tablet. It worked. Heck, before we did that, I had to run a copy of something real quick. I had already plugged it in, so I just hit the copy button after feeding what we needed into the right slot. That worked.So, yeah, there's more to it than that. We set up the printer on the WIFI at home. I used the interface directly on the printer. It was easy, quick and intuitive. I had no more finished when my machine beeped. It had recognized the printer and had already negotiated my machine to have access to it.The only work involved was getting the scanning software set up on my wife's machine and then getting her to act as the scan recipient (my machine had assumed that job). It was maybe, five minutes, max.The quality of the prints are good. The noise factor is low. The speed is adequate for a small family and a work-out-of-the-house business. Scans are accurate.

The price on the replacement ink is enough to buy another printer AND more. There are four different toners that would need replacement.

I did not find anywhere that would allow you to scan to your PC, the most basic functionality that would make scanning make sense. The document feeder works fine and wireless was easy to set up.This unit is quite heavy. The printing is decently fast but I've only used it for printing black and white so far.

There is no software that installs with the printer making any setup that much harder. The instructions are non-existent, even if you can find something online. If you need functionality that should be common on any printer still on the market, skip this one and go with something newer. Shame on the vendor for not posting the age of the printer, which I found out later was last manufactured in 2015.Note: I called Lexmark tech support to attempt to get the scan setup working, and 1 hour later they still had no clue and gave up.

Typically most people don't use a laser printer at home because the replacement toner is so crazy expensive, but this isn't enough printer for a huge office either. Maybe a very small business, even a home business? It definitely yields very professional results.It took me a little while to get it set up, as I don't have a disc drive (it comes with an install disc, but for some of us that's not helpful). The enclosed instructions were not very helpful, and the on-board touchscreen wanted me to set it up for mobile using my phone, then did not provide the correct QR code or series of numbers for me to get it working. Finally I did a manual driver search using my computer's install-printer settings. Even that was a little more complex than usual because it wanted me to enter the printer's IP address manually; fortunately that number WAS on the little touchscreen, and after that it was smooth sailing.After the minor hiccups of setting it up, it worked fast and extremely well! I needed to print a full-color comic book page onto cardstock right away, and it spat it out in about 10 seconds looking absolutely perfect. I understand I'll run out of toner in about a week if I make that a habit, but it is nice to have that capability when I need it! So far it has printed very crisp, professional looking documents, and the full color prints have been absolutely flawless.It is a little larger than my inkjet (which admittedly is a big, multi-function inkjet) and it is A LOT HEAVIER. So be sure you have a good printer stand for it, because it needs it's own place. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone and everyone for home use, as it is a whole lot of printer for just the occasional job. But if you need excellent quality printing and are able to pay for supplies, this is a very solid model."

I sometimes print photos and images on blank DVD disks, and I love that my Canon printer can do that in a very high-quality way. This Lexmark, not so much. Also, it's considerably larger than my Canon.It does spit out pages fairly quickly, about one every 3 seconds, and if you just need black and white document copies, this is a good printer for that. It's really best suited for office work.Another downside is that the toner is quite expensive. I was hoping to find a generic toner that would be compatible, but apparently none such exists yet. I know people who much prefer laser printers to inkjet, and perhaps it will last longer than my Canon inkjet printer -- I have gone through three inkjets in the last eight years -- but I still prefer the nice quality color printing of an inkjet."

Wireless, USB or Ethernet",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBTHRAZ152JT9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,,"I do like this printer but my out of box experience was not great. I unboxed it and removed the tape from the various locations that are supposed to keep things in place during shipping. I answered a few questions on the little screen like what language do I speak and timezone, etc. Then I adjusted the paper tray to fit Letter size paper. With letter paper, the drawer hangs out of the back of the printer a little. I said to keep the paper size as letter and it said to clear a jam in the back of the printer.Well, I assumed it had to do with the paper tray since that stuck out. It was actually a piece in the door on the back of the printer that was causing the issue. Once I opened that drawer and put the piece in properly, everything went well.I got the driver from the Lexmark website. I plugged it in via ethernet and the IP address conveniently displayed on the screen. I was able to print right away.I have to say that these little printers are pretty impressive these days. I worked on laser printers and even repaired them way back in the HP 4 days. Those printers could not duplex and didn't print anywhere near as fast as these modern laser printers.I think this is a nice desk printer for someone in an office or home office. It is a great little home printer. The biggest thing for me is that it is laser and not inkjet. I have tried to use color inkjets for years. They print nice quality and the color is great. The downside is that I don't print color all that often and when I do print it is almost always black and white. (or black and white would be acceptable at least for my purposes) The ink would always dry up between uses on my inkjet printers and the ink costs more than the printer. (like razors and razor blades)It turns out that toner for this laser is quite expensive and depending on how you order it, it can be close to the price of the printer. (though the price here is very good at the moment at around $100) There are 3 different capacity toners. If you use the Lexmark return program, you save a lot of money. (you give them the empty cartridge back and you save a ton)I'm sure there will be 3rd party toner options at some point but this is what I found on the Lexmark site as far as pricing for the return program toner:Lexmark B221000 Black Return Program Toner CartridgeB221000 1200 $44.99Lexmark B221H00 Black High Yield Return Program Toner CartridgeB221H00 3,000 $79.99Lexmark B221X00 Black Extra High Yield Return Program Toner CartridgeB221X00 6,000 $159.99I only listed the price of the return program toners because the other ones are really expensive and it wouldn't make sense to buy them. (just return it and save a lot) I assume that 3rd party toners will be available at some point and may not require you to return them for a reasonable price.I have no complaints about the printer. It is somewhat compact, quiet and fast. It even prints duplex (2-sided) if you want. I love that it is WiFi capable. I had several old HP printers laying around my house that had good toner in them until fairly recently. I was basically able to print for free. They smelled bad, took up too much space and took forever to warm up.These modern, compact, desktop printers are pretty impressive. I think if you compare the cost of toner for this printer with an inkjet printer, the laser is a little less expensive on paper. In the real world, however, if you have to change your ink cartridges in your inkjet because they dried out, the laser is way less expensive.I do keep a color inkjet around for printing photos. I do not look forward to using it and going through the cleaning cycles and possibly buying ink cartridges when it has sat too long. For most of my printing, this little guy will do what I want."
R3E4SR1S3M306F,"August 6, 2019",D. Michael Elkins,Vine Customer,4,B2236dw,N/A,0,0,No,"Mac users, please set up using a printer cable!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E4SR1S3M306F?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,," I spent at least a half hour trying to figure out how to set up this printer to use with my Mac computer and laptop today. Visit the Lexmark website and you'll see a message that makes it appear that there isn't a driver available but then there's also something to download that will download but won't readily open with any application. I then just tried to add the printer using the ""add printer"" command in the system preferences but the computers could not find the printer. I was then about ready to give up when I noticed an option of connecting the printer by using a printer cable, which of course, is never supplied with any printer that you buy. I salvaged one from an old printer, attached it to my computer and the printer and the printer showed up immediately as one of my ""add printer"" options. Once I had added the printer, I was able to disconnect the cable and it printed flawlessly thereafter through my office's wireless network.Something that I found strange was when I tried to load up standard 8x11 copy paper. Although you wouldn't expect it, to load what I consider the standard size paper, you must extend the back of the tray from its normal configuration, which causes the back of the tray to extend out from the back of the printer, as seen in the attached picture. Why?Once I was able to get the printer up and running, I had no problems with it operating smoothly and quickly as can be seen in my video.I am using this printer as a replacement for my workhorse Brother HL-L2370DW, which still works fine but for the annoying warning about me needing to replace parts, even after they have already been replaced. Yes, I have searched online for the fix but the suggested one didn't work. You would think that if a unit is smart enough to know when it is time to replace a part, it should be smart enough to know when that part has been replaced without the owner having to go online to determine how to reset the warning indicator."
R20RGYCO94IM01,"August 5, 2019",Shadez82,Vine Customer,4,B2236dw,N/A,0,0,No,"Really nice laser printer, but lacks instruction",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20RGYCO94IM01?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,,This laser printer is great! First thing I noticed right out of the box is that it is SUPER light. I had no issues removing it from the box and carrying it over. There is a grip on the bottom of the printer so you do not have to worry about it sliding. The printer does lack instructions I feel for setting up. I looked through all the box but there are only warning and a physical setup for the device. One thing about the physical device setup is that you need to make sure to remove all the table and the covers for the toner cartridge. I would recommend that when removing the covers for the toner to do it possibly outside. The reason being is that there is a plastic tab you need to pull and remove. I honestly though I would break it pulling this plastic strip out but it does take a good amount of pull to remove. Do not worry this is something you NEED to remove to bring printing. It will carry about a small amount of toner if you are pulling on it so doing it outside will ensure you do not get toner all over your desk or carpet. Also when remove the paper cover just cut or rip it slowly and remove it. There is a part on the toner you do not want to touch. There is a drive disk if you need it but if you do not have it a simple google of the model will take you to the download page. The paper tray will have not have the paper completely pushed down and that's okay. It will be elevated in the tray. The screen just traditional black and white. There is no color or visual and the controls are fairly easy to navigate once you get use to it. The setup was a bit annoying as it loops for some reason through a lot of the setup. The printer does use a traditional computer plug to power the device and uses a type b usb cable. Be aware that the device does not come with that cable so if you want to do a direct connection you will need to purchase that separately. You can manually set up the wifi on the device itself just be aware you will have to rotate through all of the different characters. I have not had any connection issues and once on the internet network you can easily search for the printer on the network and connect to it. The printer prints super fast. It can shoot out the printout in I would say 1-2 seconds after it is done warming up. You do not have to wait very long to get the print out. It has all the indicator lights to show low on toner or low on paper. It is not a very big printer so you do not have to worry about it taking up too much space. Overall this print is a nice printer to have if you only print in black and white as well as want something that will last you a long time before replacing the toner. It also great to have for a small office as well. The only issue I have is the instructions apart from the physical setup is lacking.

So glad I decided to pick this one up and give it a try! I will post pictures as soon as I get it in it's permanent home ( we are packing up for a move) I will also post a video of it in use!"
RJI0VX8V39ZGZ,"July 31, 2019",Summit,Vine Customer,1,C3326dw,N/A,11,1,No,Built like a tank & fast,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJI0VX8V39ZGZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,,"I'm no stranger to laser printers- I worked my way through the I.T. industry, starting as the 'computer guy' who would come to your office to make your computers function- often elbows deep in a laser printer. Lexmark was originally a part of IBM and was separated in 1991 to be its own thing, but IBM is the go-to company for business class machines- it's even part of their name. The Lexmark printers are well known to business computing people, but probably less known to people who don't work in the computer biz and home users. Their products tend to be built to take a beating and this printer is no exception.One thing that stood out was the steel frame. It's a heavy, industrial quality machine. There isn't any ""fluff"" on it like many printers have- like touch screens and stylistic design. It's simple. The toner tray is unique and the paper tray is more simple than many- but that simplicity makes it durable. The tray latches in with a confident feel. By comparison, my HP color laser has a loose fitting, sloppy paper tray.I don't want more apps on my phone, so I configured this using the super simple little screen and buttons. The longest part was entering the password for the 2.4G network (it isn't compatible with the 5G network, boo...) but despite the simple buttons, it didn't take long as it quickly scrolls through letters and numbers. It connected instantly. I installed the whole software and driver package from the web site and noticed there is a new firmware upgrade as of a couple weeks ago- so I will apply that soon. The web site linked to the icon Lexmark places in their Windows software doesn't work. In fact, I can only bring up the printer settings when printing something- the printer control panel doesn't work any other way. One can also directly connect to the printer's web interface by simply putting the printer IP in a browser window. This is also how one updates the firmware once downloaded.Now, here's where things went a little strange. The printing I get is VERY fast and black and white prints are crisp. It defaults to printing both sides, which is annoying so I have to change settings. Color prints on mine are terrible, but since nobody else is reporting this problem I'm guessing it's because the delivery person tossed this in my driveway. I heard it hit the ground from inside the house. Packaging was minimal- the inside box has the molded foam around the printer but there was no padding between that box and the shipping box. I'll be looking into the problem more after the firmware update but the blue cartridge may be the issue. Printing various solid colors, the blue is extremely blotchy although no sign of toner leakage or damage to the cartridge. Until that is resolved, the color printing on this is extremely poor. Despite the color issue, the grainy appearance when printing a photo quality source is not nearly as good as my 6 year old HP color laser. For now, I'm only taking a star off for the wonky interface and the lousy software. Lexmark has always had wonky interfaces, but they make awesome business class printers. The printing issue on mine appears to be an anomaly and I'll update as I look to resolve it.*** update. all printing is blotchy to the point I can't even use the prints for draft working copies. I've gone through everything possible to attempt to resolve it to no avail. Not looking forward to having to deal with warranty and tech support- but I'll go through all that when I can find extra time to kill.****Second update. After trying a few basic things to try to reset the printer, it has failed to the point where it is now just a waste of space in my house. Warranty? Good luck with that. It was probably damaged when the USPS delivery involved throwing it in my driveway. Dropping off at the recycling depot today where I'll have to PAY to get rid of it."

To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan of Lexmark products, but this printer is really really well made and really really fast and sharp. Super easy to set up the WiFi, and to replace the toner cartridges. The paper is fast and easy to load, which I feel is important as well. So far no jams, but you really need to fan the paper before you load it. As to how long the toner lasts, I don't know, but there are ink saving settings if that is a concern of yours. Either way, I really like this printer."

Super easy to set up -- it was operating in under five minutes! Fast, clean printing, too. I also installed the software on my laptop, allowing me to print wirelessly from anywhere in the house. Then I installed the printer app on my mobile phone (that took a few minutes to figure out, but once it configured it works great).I'm very pleased with how fast the printer starts printing once I send a document -- it's literally just a few seconds. And again, the printing is clean and clear, both B&W and color. Printer tray holds 250 sheets, which is average for most of today's printers. I'd love if it would hold an entire ream, but if that's my only complaint, I have no real complaint.I used an Okidata C5200 laser printer for more than a decade and it performed GREAT. So after it finally gave up the ghost I bought another Oki, but I was very disappointed. I've since tried Brother and HP, but for color printing, this Lexmark seems to have all its ducks in a row. It performs soundly and does NOT sound or feel cheap. I'm pleased as punch and because of its solid build, my impression is that it's going to last a long time. I'm giving it five solid stars."

I'm able to print from my two Windows-based computers and from my android phone. Document quality is superb, but photo quality is mediocre. I expected that when buying a laser, so no points off.I had several problems setting it up, most of which I think are due to a weak wifi radio. The printer is on the opposite end of the house from my router with walls, cabinets, a refrigerator between them. That said, other devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc) work ok in this office.When turning on the printer for the first time, the screen showed a message telling me to go to a specific URL and download the Lexmark software for my mobile device to help set up the printer. I just went to the Google Play store and searched for Lexmark Mobile Assistant, and it came right up. Installed that and started the configuration. It seemed a bit complicated, but ended up working fine to configure the printer.Within the app, it suggested downloading the Lexmark printing app and the Lexmark print plugin. I did both and tried to print a picture from my phone. That's where the problems started. It would fail to connect, then connect ok long enough to send a print, then it couldn't connect anymore.I switched to setting up the Windows computers, downloaded the software from Lexmark (skipped using the CD, as they're usually out-of-date), and started the install. It couldn't locate the printer on the network, and after several tries using a couple of the options, I just clicked the Advanced button, typed in the IP address manually, and the install finished. Once that was finished, Windows could print and the printer spit out the paper with what I expected, but every time, I saw a message pop up that it couldn't connect to the printer.Eventually, after troubleshooting and searching Google, I decided to try plugging it in through an ethernet cable instead of worrying with wifi. After changing the Windows printer port to reflect the new IP address, I stopped getting the can't connect error. After deleting and re-adding the printer on my phone, it can now print as well.Overall, I'm happy with the printer, as it has the features I need for a reasonable price. As an IT person, I was able to work through the difficulties caused by the weak wifi radio, but I don't know that someone not familiar with networking would have been able to without assistance."

The printer was delivered without written support to setup this printer. Lexmark's online information is essentially meaningless. It was not only hard to understand, but it was vastly incomplete and misleading. After spending over 10 hours on the telephone with Lexmark's 3rd party contractor/support team, the technician got the printer to print properly. The technician could not get the scanner to function with the Lexmark information supplied to the 3rd party support team. The scanner worked after being ""jerry rigged"" by the technician with a non Lexmark product. Whoever designed Lexmark's software did not seem know what they were doing. The printer is built like a tank with the brain of a worm. I finally gave up and returned the printer to Amazon."

As soon as it was set up it was obvious that the print quality was very poor.

A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience. Its possible that if you happen to get a working printer, it might serve you well. But don't count on much in the way of support from Lexmark if you happen to get a dud."

If you copy or print anything that's more like diagrams or line art, the colors are great. Set up was smooth -- not quite as easy at the HP, but nothing to complain about. Print time and sound are similar to the HP. The HP is a little quieter. But since this has a scanner also, for copying, unless you only need the printer, this is a better buy than the HP."

It’s really well made, offers a ton of great features, and looks pretty good on my desk. While my needs for this printer aren’t many (I have another printer for my home office), it’s worked really well for me so far and I’d be happy to recommend it.Pros:When printing the black text shows up crisp and clear on the page, proving immediately that it’s a quality piece of equipment. It’s bold and punchy, and I haven’t had any trouble reading anything I’ve printed yet. The color printing for photos and images is pretty good, though I’ve seen much better from other printers. It’ll work just fine as long as printing color isn’t your main objective. After setup, the printer easily connects to my devices (Macbook, Android) without fail, and I’ve absolutely never had a problem.I love that the printer is so quiet - it doesn’t even wake my sleeping pets when they’re in the same room! The scanning feature is pretty easy to use and self explanatory with a regular speed. The small touchscreen is easy to use and lends a modern feel to the machine. Everything on the machine is high quality, and it feels like it’s made to last. Nothing flimsy whatsoever.Cons:As mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t recommend this printer if photos and color-use are your main objectives. While the printer works fine for these things, the vibrance is notably less than for my previous printer (Epson Workforce Pro WF-4630). This feels nitpicky, but I’d really have expected a larger paper tray from a printer of this size and price.Setup took a little longer than I’d prefer - you have to install a driver and painstakingly connect the printer to all your devices. Again, once setup, you’re good to go, but know that you’ll be sitting down for a good half hour or so to get it all working. For home use, I find the printer size a bit much. It appears to me a little smaller in the photos, so I was surprised when it arrived and I had to find a bigger spot for it.Overall, though, it’s a pretty good product. I’d happy suggest it."

Wireless capable and fast.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGN6CJJRKWO81?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"This is a nice compact color printer. It also allows you to scan, fax and copy. The printer can copy/scan/print in 600dpi but if you use the photo settings you can get results that look better than 600dpi. It will not produce the results you would expect from a photo printer but it can produce nice quality output if you use the right settings.The touch screen is also in color and is bright and clear. (you can see it at an angle easily as well) It is nice to scroll through the menus like you would on your smartphone. (touch and drag)The scanner seems to make images a little brighter and a more 'washed out' than the original in some cases. The software comes with a TWAIN-compliant driver that will let you import images into your favorite graphics manipulation program. (like Photoshop for example) I was able to scan photos with close to photo-quality output by selecting the Photo Mode from the menu of the TWIAN driver and changing the dpi setting to 600. The image looked better than 600dpi but it did scan in 600dpi. The full 8.5x11 sheet was 5100 x 6600 pixels. (if you divide the pixels by 600 it ends up being 8.5 x 11)For office or home use, it is a great little printer as long as you aren't expecting it to print photo quality. One nice thing about a laser printer is that it can sit of years without issues, unlike an inkjet where the ink can dry and cause issues if it is not used frequently.The printer was easy to install and comes with an actual CD/DVD. (you can find the driver on Epson's website very easily if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer) It can also be set up to print from a phone over WiFi. My experience with printing from a phone is that it is a last resort since the phone itself limits the control you have over the print output.In summary, the printer only prints in 600dpi but some kind of enhancement is going on that makes photos look better than 600dpi when it is used. Even with those settings, it does not with photo quality results. For graphics, text and even photo-like quality, it is a great all-around multifunction.The printer goes to sleep on its own after a bit so to use it wirelessly you may need to power it on. It can be used as a scanner though it can only scan at 600dpi. (photo mode enhances the image for photos) I haven't tried the fax functionality since I do not fax much. The copier functionality is slick. You can navigate through the menus to get the optimal settings.It does everything I would expect it to do. The photo enhancements from photo mode produced very nice results for 600dpi, even though the output is not photo quality. I printed a picture of my friend's Camaro on regular copy paper for reference."

This Lexmark has so far fit the bill well with it compact size, quiet operation, and fast printing capability. There are many features packed into this printer, all of which is controlled on the almost over-sensitive touch screen (perhaps my fingers are just too big). Setup was fairly straightforward for me and I didn't need any assistance. Wired and wireless connections work very well and I have had zero problems with wireless connections.Print quality is excellent for text, and so-so for images. However, if you are looking to print quality images, that is where an inkjet will still be handy. For that reason, my old inkjet will stick around strictly for printing images.Lexmark also offers an exchange program for their toner cartridges, saving the consumer about 25%. You purchase a toner cartridge from Lexmark, in exchange for your old one. However, it appears that of the time of this review, it is currently unavailable.Overall, for a home, or even office, this is an excellent printer. Even if you don't print often at all, but need the printer to work at the snap of your fingers, I would suggest this laser printer over an inkjet because unlike ink, toner won't dry out and become waste. You will pay the price upfront, but over the life of the printer, you will more than make up for the cost in the long run."

They are not extremely heavy printers but tend to also need to do some occasional scanning, were interested in the idea of being able to fax medical paperwork when they can't upload in an app, and liked the idea of not having to replace ink continually. So we're in business with this printer.Hardware: Very well constructed, more durably made than your average HP or Canon these days.Packing: Very well packed in materials that did not get damaged nor have issues during shipping.Unpacking: Very easy to slide out of the box, no acrobatics requiredSetup: Setup is very easy. I used the menu rather than an app or installing things on a computerAfter setup and installing the local drivers and configuring them, the printer is very responsive for printing even though its allowed to sleep most of the time. It also works well with AirPrint which is fantastic!The LCD screen is bright, color, and easy to use. The touch buttons are also very easy to use. The functionality of the scanner, toner loading, other physical functions are easy. Double side printing is very easy.This was almost a 5 star review but there were a couple software issues that got in the way and I'm sure will be resolved with software updates.1. When setting up the fax, no matter how many times I named the fax, it wouldn't save. I had to skip it and do it later by navigating the menu.2. The printer for some reason came thinking it's main paper tray was ""colored paper"" which caused every single computer I set up to cause the printer to throw an error every time they tried to print to ""plain paper"" which is the default for every printer in the world forever and always for it's main paper tray-- I'd guess this was a setup bug/error.3. I cannot for the life of me get the software and driver for Windows 10 to recognize this model of printer to display a scanning utility. I'm expecting this to be solved by a software update as well. I know this printer was listed as ""just announced"" on the web site. The driver installs fine, I can print fine, but when I open the utility for scanning it says no compatible models found. Even Windows 10 recognizes the scanning device but...So summary: The printer is fantastic, I love it, I wouldn't hesitate on buying but only if scanning over the network is absolutely essential, and I'd guess that should be solved soon. I'll update if I know it's fixed in a software update."

R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,Vine Customer,4,MC3224adwe,N/A,33,0,No,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended."

Both ethernet and wireless compatible, the technology allows you to set up the device according to your needs, even if you choose to print from your cellphone. You can scan, fax, and print. The color copies it makes are crisp and clear. At around 40 pounds, the printer can be moved if needed. It measures 13 inches high, 15 ½ inches wide, and 14 ½ inches deep, which makes it almost a square shape and capable of fitting in smaller spaces.A small control screen that is touch-enabled is located on the left front of the unit. The keypad that comes up is very touch-sensitive. I had to enter my long wireless information more than once in setting the printer up. The only negative I have encountered in using the printer is in the set-up. Instructions are clear and detailed for removing the clear tapes and plastic tabs, keeping the toner ink in place. You may need to chat online with a company representative as I did to ensure you have established connectivity to all your devices.You do have to download the printer driver which comes on a provided disc or from the given website. You will also need to enter your unique wireless information on your printer keypad if you are choosing this method. All in all, this was not a bad experience; the representative was very helpful and clear; however, the set-up process is not entirely intuitive.The printer functions beautifully. We have it connected to two laptops. I love its quiet operation and fast 24 pages per minutes printing speed."
