R308V8ELPTPG08,"July 30, 2020",James M. Mcguire,3,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Printer is working but it's a returned printer.,"While setting printer up I noticed a few things that were not right. The tabs that you are required to remove for each color and black printing were missing. Next, when I opened the paper tray, there was paper already in it. When I went through the setup, I found it had already been set up once before in May of this year (this is July). Clearly, I didn't get the NEW printer I had ordered. The WiFi setup was harder than any other printer I have used to date (I've set up 5 since WiFi was an option), but I finally got it working. Print quality is OK for B/W text but not dark and uniform when using large fonts. The user manual was missing but I downloaded it on a PDF. Oh yeah, there was no registration card for warranty purposes. We'll see how hard it will be to register it online.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R308V8ELPTPG08?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

R3LQOVVEX25D52,"July 16, 2020",kmt22,1,C3224dw,Verified Purchase,Not good,"I did not believe the one star reviews mixed 50/50 with five star reviews - I wish I had. I bought this to use with Android phones in my household. If this printer works well, it must only be for certain phone types. This review is for use with the LGV50 ThinQ and Samsung Note 8.- Documentation is inadequate or non-existent. It's enough to get cartridges installed and printer turned on. After that, virtually no online reference to this specific printer exists, whether it be detailed manuals, online forums discussing specific problems, mobile drivers, etc. The only ""support"" that is useful is this page of Amazon customer reviews.- Wireless setup is cumbersome but not impossible. I was able to connect to my home wifi and produce a Wi-Fi direct network using the front panel. Feels like texting did in the year 2003, tapping each character out. It's easy to set a static IP address if desired, but this made no improvement in my ability to connect.- Due to wireless connectivity issues, I purchased a USB-B to USB-C cable. That's right, this does not support multi use USB and requires the ancient square USB type which I specially ordered on Amazon. No USB cables were supplied with my printer.- The Lexmark app from the Google play store specifically does not support this model of printer. I was able to load my doc but in the end, no connection to the printer. That leaves third party apps only.- Printers could be set up and available in my printer apps, but when selected, the printer is always ""unavailable right now."" Even when the printer happened to recognize a connection which I accepted on its front panel, the app would return ""internal printer error."" It takes over an hour of cycling apps and connection types to finally get a connection. I have had intermediate success with Samsung Print Service (even on my LG phone) and NoKo Print (over USB only). I have never been able to print from Lexmark Print or Mopria (supposed to be the universal standard of mobile print drivers with a consortium of manufacturers).- Note that print is only possible for photos and pdfs. Do not expect to print a webpage or other content without making a pdf first, unless specifically supported by the app.- The buffer is small. It will print one page, pause, print the next, pause. This takes up a lot of time for multi page documents.- Print quality is as expected from a cheap laser printer. Relatively crisp depending on the document. Occasionally get a thin red stripe down one side of the page. Pictures are ok, not great.- The thing weighs 50 pounds. How can I return that?? Get a strong desk or stand.In the end, this printer will let you down. If you are unlucky enough that your device doesn't play nicely, there is no remedy. I spend around an hour fighting with the printer each time I need something, usually an important form or tax document. Sometimes I just give up. And it doesn't even have a scanner, so it has no redeeming qualities. Save your money and go to a brick and mortar store to purchase a printer that is known to work with mobile devices. They cost more because they WORK. I am sorry I bought this.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LQOVVEX25D52?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,0,0,No,

The price was right and Lexmark does have a good reputation. While the quality of printing and copying is good the software interface is just awful. It's clear that the lexmark programmers are sloppy and just not in tune with reality. User instructions are poor, and even the online stuff is bad. The printer is constantly going into ""offline"" mode and there is no way to change that except to unplug the device. You can;t even power down and then up again to reset it. You actually have to disconnect the power cord. So dumb. The scanner/copier feeder is also poor in that it can only handle about 5 pages otherwise it gets jammed.Scanning is also another issue as you actually have to set up the email account on the printer to get it to work or use a USB stick. Also dumb.

I wanted a color printer since I do print documents and articles with color prints and images. Instead of an inkjet I decided to buy this laser printer, anticipating it would be cheaper in the long run than inkjet. I was wrong. After the 2nd week of having it I ran out of black toner which the printer informed me was low. I ordered the toner ($90 by the way), you have to order it since it is not sold in stores, (tried staples, best buy, office max, walmart, target, costco, etc). After the toner arrived I installed it and tried to print but it would not print since now the color toners were out. It did not mention that. I thought ok, I will only print in black and white or grayscale until I can get the color toner replaced. NOPE it will not print if any toner is out. I look up the color toner to purchase and it cost $100 MORE than the printer cost!!! I should have looked at that before buying the printer but I did not expect it to be so expensive. It is now a VERY expensive paperweight, as I refuse to pay more for my toner than for my printer. I ended up buying an inkjet, and although I will probably spend more money in the long run, I live paycheck to paycheck, I can purchase a $30 ink cartridge here and there, I can not drop $350 all at one time for toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16KJZQTOTLVJC?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,3,0,No,

R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ,"July 20, 2020",So disappointed,5,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,Amended review,"I purchased this printer after a great deal of long research. I broke my beloved canon and had been wanting to buy a color laser for over a year, and I purchased it after reviews from Amazon. I was aware the toner would not last very long, the estimate ranged from 200-300 pages, but the yellow toner ran out after only a few pages, and the printer would not print except in black without two yellow streaks down the side of the page. Prior to that, the print quality was fantastic -- it was super easy to set up - my computer did all the work -- it is connected to my printer via a cord, so I'm not doing any wireless printing -- I'm old, and I print mainly from digitals stored in my computer, so wireless is not a necessity for me -- Even though the printer was advertised as ""new"" I was concerned it had been returned -- I contacted Amazon via chat, and the young man that resolved my issue could not have been more helpful -- I could not find any generic or after-market cartridges such as ones available for canon and HP. I finally found replacement Lexmark cartridges from a company called quill.com -- at the most reasonable price I could find -- it was still $80, but it's supposed to last for roughly 600 pages -- this is the recycling program, which I like -- you could buy a cartridge with longer life for about $20 more -- also, I watched videos on youtube about replacing the toner powder at home and then resetting the printer chip -- you can buy toner for about $13 -- that may be an avenue I experiment with -- but as far as ease of use and print quality, I love it very much -- I make journals and one of the downfalls is, if you get a drop of water on an inkjet image, the whole page is ruined because it will smear -- I've had mono laser printers since the 1990's, so I knew if you act quickly, it could be saved -- when the printer arrived, I did a lot of water tests, and was very pleased with the results. Now that I know I can find cartridges at a reasonable cost, I'm much happier -- if you purchase from this seller, contact them prior to shipping -- shipping was delayed, and I still wonder if this was a returned printer -- so get sales person's name and write down exactly what they tell you. I hope this helps with your research.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1D5YPWOKVUXKJ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,0,No,
R1CLTKNQSPQYOF,"July 19, 2020",Donald V. Rutkowski Jr.,1,MC3224dwe,Verified Purchase,The scanner functional is not efficient.,"The printer was easy to setup and I was printing paper within minutes. Now the scanner part, is a whole different story. After spending about 4 to 5 hours trouble shooting the scanner issue, I finally figured out how to scan from the printer to the computer and its not efficient at all.First you have to download the ""Lexmark Scanback Utility"", which is not part of the original driver package. Once you install and start running the utility, you will create a scanner profile. Second, you have to go back to the printer, load the paper you want to scan, then select the scanner profile you created. Once that is all done, you have successfully scanned your document. The big issue about this is, you have to run this process each time you want to scan a document. Your scanner profile is not saved to printer. Each time, you have to start the profile, load the paper then select the profile. After spending all this time on this new printer, I actually figured out how to get my older printer working better than this one.I am looking to return this somehow.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CLTKNQSPQYOF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,1,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review.

R30TVCKU4YYDM2,"June 24, 2020",Kevin Harrington,2,MC3426adw,Verified Purchase,Right Out Of The Box,"Set up for this printer is relatively easy *if* you have some knowledge of networking via ethernet and/or WiFi. It's not too difficult. The printer arrived where the carton appeared to be in excellent condition. The unit is well padded, and plenty of security tape to keep doors, trays and lids in place during shipping. Getting the printer up and running was easy for both the Mac and PC systems. The catch with this printer is the paper tray. The tray isn't the best solution in the printer industry. Considering the printer is 50 lbs. in weight, I'd assume the paper tray would have been constructed with metal guides and a solid tray solution. Not the case, it is all plastic. The tray and the printer paper *pick up function* didn't work well right out of the box. Of several 10's of sheets of different paper, none of the paper used would be successfully drawn from the tray to be printed. The printer *pick up function* from the tray was inadequate, with only one sheet out of 20+ attempts to print with this printer.Paper used: HP Premium 20 lb. paper HP Premium 24 lb. paper HP Premium 32 lb. paper HP Mulitpurpose 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Paper 20 lb. paper Hammermill Copy Plus 20 lb. paperThe tray filled with each of the different paper types, filed at full capacity, half capacity, near empty capacity... the results were the same. Every type of paper would begin its journey as the *pick up mechanism* would extract about 2 inches of the top sheet, then slice two one inch tears into the edge of the paper. The printer would report the *tray out of paper.* Clearly there's something wrong with this printer, at least the one received. The remedy to clear the ""out of paper"" error was to remove the tray, remove the damaged top sheet, then install the tray, and do the same thing over, and over, and over again.The price for a scanner, printer, fax, copier machine is reasonable, but if it doesn't work, it's a waste of time.The other Lexmark printer owned for several months/years is the model C2535.

This compact color MFP can fit almost anywhere. (13. 6 x 16. 2 x 15. 5 inches / 344. 4 x 411. 2 x 394. 1 mm), according to its makers. It is also, according to its makers, easy to use: its makers claim that it is plug it in and ready to go. Furthermore, they add that its standard wi-fi makes it easy to print from mobile devices.That it is interconnective: its 2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information. That it will enable the user to scan to network, email, FTP, or USB stick drive, scan to, print files from popular cloud services with Lexmark's Cloud Connector, while providing security. That its extra high yield unison toner will provide up to 4, 500 pages of output, so the user can print more, stop less. And it is durable, as its steel frame, long-life imaging components mean it’s built to last. So the user can get solid performance, get things done with a 1-GHz dual-core processor, output up to 26 ppm. The manufacturers also state that the printer, with its Unison Toner, will deliver rich, vibrant color with crisp details, for outstanding quality. The manufacturers also claim that this printer will deliver media flexibility, enabling the user to get universal media handing from A6 to legal; support for specialty media like envelopes, optional input expandable up to 751 pages.

Then, setting it up is anything but easy: the makers offer a coupla pages of weird diagrams, no written instructions, and a CD. Whose computer has CD portals anymore? Then, it doesn’t print pictures, to those of you who might want to. And it needs lithium batteries which are difficult to fit, pricey. But my main problem with it was my difficulty in figuring out the scan function, which is not even listed on its index of available functions. ( And, by the way, its touch screen is tiny.) And figuring out how to scan was difficult even with the help of my professional computer guru. In my life, I must have the ability to scan, as, even though this printer, like my previous model, offers the ability to fax, the wiring in my place doesn’t allow this function. So I must scan and email important documents. Gotta scan.

R8Z4KZYQ63GSK,"May 26, 2020",S. Brown,2,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,no documentation and heavier than most printer stands can take,"I was excited to be offered to test and review this printer. Most of the places I’ve worked at have had Lexmark printers as they are such workhorses. But I haven’t personally owned one and so never had to try to set one up before.First thing you need to know is that this printer is HEAVY. It comes in at 50 pounds. And until I got this, I had no idea that almost all printer stands will only support a printer of 30 pounds. It took me awhile to find a stand that would be big enough (it also has a larger footprint than my previous printers) and sturdy enough and rated to handle the weight of this. After I found one and ordered it, I was contacted by the seller, in very broken English, asking me to please cancel the order because they really didn’t have any stands! After many more hours of searching, I gave up on printer stands and found instead a “roll cart with drawers” (no longer available) that was big enough and rated to hold the weight. After it finally arrived, I then had to assemble it and wait for the glue to dry before I could use it.So now the printer is on the stand and I am ready to set it up. Not. There are no directions or manual or any real info with this. All it came with are several pages of pictures showing you how to remove all the tape and packing material in, on and around the printer. The only other thing they show is putting the CD into your computer. I tried that. It did NOTHING. The CD does not have a manual or info or anything like that on it. Instead it appears to be a program that will auto install the drivers and optionally some utilities. However, you have to first have the printer on your wifi.There are NO directions or information on how to connect to your wifi. On all of my previous wifi printers, they came with detailed, step by step directions that were easy to follow. This printer leaves you to figure it out yourself. First issue is the password.The touch screen “buttons” you need to press to enter your password as so tiny that I found it impossible to know if I pressed the right one. This is due to the fact that the screen does not show you what you pressed! Not even momentarily. Nope, it gives you nothing but asterisk. Maybe if I had a short password, it would be ok, but ours is very long and a mix of letters and numbers. I tried repeatedly, but it would not work for me. After a few more days I found an old rubber tipped stylus and that helped. They next problem was with our router (I didn’t have anything to do with the purchase of this or it’s setup – it is NOT one I would have chose).I finally seemed to have gotten the right combination of “buttons” on the printer and the router pushed and with the stylus, the right characters for the password input and it connected to wifi. Running the CD was easy and I did install one of the optional programs.You would think all is fine finally and I would be able to use the printer. And you would be wrong. I thought I would start by scanning in some art that I recently finished. On almost every printer I’ve worked with before, there would be a “button” for “print”, “fax”, “copy”, and “scan”. Nothing so simple on this one. The only “scan” option says “scan profiles”. Since there are no instructions for anything, I push that. Big mistake evidently. The printer locked up. It was completely non-responsive.After 30 minutes, I gave up and pulled the plug. That seemed to reset it from the beginning when I first turned it on. It did however, remember the network and connect itself without my intervention. It takes several minutes to get itself ready. Now I no longer have the “scan properties” option.So this time I decided to try printing from the cloud. I signed into One Drive through Word and saved this document. Went to the printer and selected One Drive. It makes me give it a name for some weird reason then tells me I have to go to a website and read pages of legalese and agree then input a code. I did all of that and found myself at a sign in to One Drive. Weird. I just signed in. So I sign in here and see nothing for me to do and can not find the cloud storage from here. It just got me to my account info with Microsoft.I go back to the printer, figuring I did what it said so I was good to go. NOT. The printer is showing me the code again and telling me I have to go agree and input the code on the website. Round and round we go. I again hit ok. BTW, before you can type that URL in and connect, the printer will flip screens so you have to again click several times to get back to the code so you can type it in. I again agree, and again am set to sign in with Microsoft. This time, MS asks if I want to let my printer have access to my cloud. Amongst the things I expected, for some reason Lexmark also is saying it has to have full access to my profile. Not sure why it would need that to print but I don’t save much to the cloud so I don’t really need to be concerned – I hope.So, I grant access and end up back at Lexmark which now has a message that I am ALMOST done. That now that it is set up, I HAVE to print from the cloud within 72 hours or it will delete all of this info and I have to start all over again. Fine. Whatever. I select the cloud and the named profile and find my directory tree as in OneDrive. Choose something to print and not sure what to do next. I take a chance and press the arrow and it prints. So that at least seems to work as advertised after you jump through the hoops.Print quality was excellent and the photos and illustrations came out fantastic. There was no banding in the gradients and the colors were good. Very pleased with this part of the printer.I can’t find any options to scan except scan to cloud. That is extremely disappointing. I don’t see why there isn’t a scan to computer option like all my other printers have had. That makes an extra step for me. Scan to cloud, go to cloud to retrieve. Why? That is just dumb. I guess they figure you only use this for business and not for ever using with photos or graphics that need repair or retouch/rework in a program on your computer.So my low rating is mainly due to the lack of documentation. I have lots of options when I click on things but no idea what they mean or do. I don’t really have the time to sit and hit all the buttons to see what happens. I have things I need it to do and simply want to know how to do them. I shouldn’t have to first figure it out on my own.-------------It is now August 2020 and I have been online and found the documentation. While it is helpful, the printer still requires you to jump through a ton of hoops to do everything except a straight print from computer.I use my printers to scan in documents and this is NOT easy on this printer. It can be done but with many many unneeded steps in comparison to EVERY single printer I have ever owned.You have to open the scan utility. I had to download that software and install first. Then you have to pick what size document you want to scan. Fine. You would think that would be it. That the printer would be smart enough for you to select this ONCE and done. Then if you needed to make a change, you would go back and change it. NO doesn't work like that.You have to give it a profile name. That name is then sent to the printer under the very unintuitive menu item of ""shortcuts"". Then you click on shortcuts and then your name and then it will do it. However it will always use the same path name and same file name for every time. NOT useful.To make it work, I set up two different profile ""shortcuts"" (interesting that they don't both appear on the printer - only the one at a time). Then I make a desktop shortcut. One is for legal sized and one is for letter. It will not print any larger than letter, but it will scan larger.So I pick either the letter or the legal desktop shortcut I made. It gives me a dialog box on the computer that I MUST answer NO to in order for this to work. if I answer yes, the scans will always over write each other. only THEN can I go over to the printer, wake it up by pushing the arrow ""button"", wait until it gives me the screen and find ""shortcuts"" then the name of the ""profile"". I forget what it is called, but I think it is just scan. I can't get it confused because I only ever see the one associated with the desktop shortcut!Then I put the item on the glass and push the arrow button again and it scans.what a huge PITA. I have never had to jump through so many hoops to do almost everything with a printer. It insists that you create profiles and each one has to have a name before it will do anything. But every time I look, there are no profiles listed in the menu. Very odd. You have to jump through this naming garbage to use the cloud print or scan also.I guess you could say I love/hate this thing. It works well, just it is a royal pain to use.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8Z4KZYQ63GSK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,2,1,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review and we are sorry to hear about the challenges you faced with setting up this printer.

This Lexmark is a step up from the quality that I’m used to from them. The construction doesn’t feel as cheap or shoddy, and it actually feels like a fairly solid printer. I like that they’re upping the quality for home laser printing. I much prefer laser quality over ink, and they have not disappointed in that regard. The toner replacement seems a little steep, but if you’re getting 4500 pages as opposed to 500, it can average out.That being said, the touch screen is a little too small for my fingers, and makes it difficult to use. The setup is pretty straight forward and easy with no real surprises if you have any kind of familiarity with printer set up.

R2T03U91SZ94NP,"May 19, 2020",Jon R,1,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, hampered by terrible software","The short version: Don’t bother with this, while the hardware is good it’s paired with terrible software that ruins the experience. You can get much better for the same price, in fact it’s actually on the upper end of what I’d consider reasonable pricing. You can probably get the same or better for even less if you look for sales.Longer version:As I said the printer hardware is nice. It’s not too big for a color laser, prints clearly on every paper type, is fairly quiet, and fast. I’d give the hardware a 4/5 if Lexmark could hire someone who knew anything about software to fix the garbage software this thing runs.Now first let me side track a bit because this needs mentioning. The instructions that come with this are ridiculous. You get a about 7 pages of paper with no words, just photos (poor ones at that) and a CD. Honestly, who still has a CD drive on their computer? If they want to throw one in, fine, but they also need a thumb drive or just tell you where to go to download manuals and let you know to do it online. The good news is those do exist, but you have to go to Lexmark’s website and find it yourself. I work in IT, so I knew how to setup a printer, but not everyone does. Those pictures (I’m not even going to call them instructions) are not going to help anyone.Now with that out of the way back to my reason for rating this printer low despite the nice hardware. The crap software. So the first thing I ran into was the printer suggested using an app to set it up faster. That’s cool, other printer have done that and it can be easier then trying to set it up on those small screens. Except this app just doesn’t work. For one thing it’s about as bare bones as you can get, and looks like it hasn’t been updated in years (and the update notes suggest it hasn’t, they only added support for newer printers). It couldn’t find the printer, which is expect during setup but it gave no instruction on how to connect to the printer. I finally got it to see the printer by using my phone’s WiFi direct. Except the app, either due to poor design or a bug, did not do any setup it went right to the main screen, and once again complained about not finding the printer. I gave up on that and decided to do it on the printer itself. I don’t think even the most petite persons fingers could type on that keypad. It took several tries to get the passwords to match because you can't see what you are typing, so I kept making typos. Next up was WiFi. Connecting to the network took a few tries, again, because there are not clear instructions included nor onscreen instructions. Once I was connected, it worked but again I am in IT and know about these things. Someone not in IT probably would have a harder time. Now begins another annoying adventure - I get through the needlessly annoying setup and arrive at the main screen. Several things have a lock beside them so I try to enter my password from earlier to unlock them, and it doesn’t work. I guess I might have typed it wrong since the keypad is so hard to use. So I go into settings and find the option to do a factory reset, nothing happens when I tap it. After some frustration I realize you have to restart the printer for the reset to happen – why wouldn’t it tell me that? Ok annoying setup again, this time I say screw the password and just make it 12345, it’s not like anyone else has access to this. Ok good news is that the password works now. Now the thing has the wrong region? What? It doesn’t let me change it either. I tried ANOTHER reset and during setup the region was STILL locked to the wrong location. After much frustration I found it can be changed via the web interface. FINALLY the printer is ready to use.First thing I try is via my phone since I have it with me. I try their app, because the app for my HP printer had been handy. Lexmark’s app is as useless as that setup app, bare bones, and outdated. I just decided to use Android’s printing and that worked. Next up my iPad. Since this is an Airport printer I decided to use that. Well, Airport was a no-go, it could never connect. I tried their iOS app and it was no better then their Android one. So basically it’s a no-go for iOS printing. And final my Windows PC. Their Windows software is trash like the rest. Windows couldn’t find the printer without Lexmark’s crap software. But I used the old manual printer setup to manually enter the IP and it was able to connect and print.See the pattern here? Lexmark should hire some high school kid to go and recode all their software, because it’s obvious nobody there knows how to do it. When you factor in the headaches this terrible software will give you, this printer is not worth the price.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2T03U91SZ94NP?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,1,2,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for your review.

Install only took minutes with finding an appropriate place for it (printer is hefty and a large size) and plugging it into power. Connection to our desktop took just a few minutes and that was able to be completed wirelessly. My wife and I also have the app connected to our phones so printing from mobile devices is easy as a few clicks. We have been through about a ream (500 pages) of paper or so and no jams. Granted we have only been using the tray and not the manual feed. Printing speed is mind-blowing, actually takes longer for the printer to process the print job and spool up than for the paper to come out. What is also very impressing is the picture printing quality when using photo paper.

R2LG9CZCCKIY1W,"June 21, 2020",Matt P.,4,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Excellent, Fast Printing In A Heavy Plastic Housing","Lexmark is known to make some excellent printers, both large and small, for business and home use. This model could be used easily for a home office, and for a small business that needs high quality prints. Set up on this is easy and straightforward, and can be used with WiFi or Ethernet. App is available for WiFi set up. i was very disappointed in the touch screen, where all your settings and options are found. This Lexmark sells for $259.00 (as of this review), and for that money, if it's gonna have a touch screen, it should be at least big enough to see the text, and definitely big enough for your fingers to be able to use it. The description states ""2. 8-inch color touch screen enables convenient interaction with essential system functions and task information"". I hardly believe it to be ""convenient interaction"" at all, when I had to enter my password for WiFi, literally, I had to do it like 5 times. I know my password, but the keyboard is so small, even my smaller fingers had a tough time landing on the touch key correctly, and hitting the right letter or number. There's plenty of real estate on here that another inch would not have interfered with anything, and made a world of difference. The price of screens like this has pretty much dropped to rock bottom, they are so widely produced, so don't understand. I have a $69 Canon that has a touch screen at least 50% bigger, and much easier to use than this.As others have stated, the paper tray is a little flimsy, not falling apart flimsy, but not as exact as I thought it would be. The entire housing looks like it's made of plastic (it states it has a metal frame), and although that in itself is not bad, it's just some parts, like the tray, could have used a little more support, and sliding in and out, it could have used a sturdier slide than what it has. If I had bought a printer for under $100 bucks (which there are more than enough of those to choose from, and getting better quality every day), this is what I would expect. As far as the main feature, and what this is built for, printing, it's excellent. Prints are sharp, even the smallest print. Pictures are color perfect, even at 8x11, they look great. All print out quickly, and to me, quietly. I know some have stated this is a loud printer. The only times I notice it is loud was the initial setup, and if it's been totally shut down. I leave mine on standby, and pretty much just makes a kind of fan running sound when it's printing, quiet to me, and then goes back to sleep until I wake it again. FYI: This is a printer only. I think a lot of people (like my wife too, was wondering where you lift up to scan and make a copy, it doesn't, this is a one trick pony, but it's excellent at it. If you are looking for a high quality printer function only, for professional looking work, this can do the job. It's also expandable to a second tray if you need to do a lot of printing. Toner is not cheap, depending on where you shop I guess. Average price I found, for the black cartridge only, was about $100 bucks, at a very well known national office supply company. But, printer toner is known to vary wildly in price, and tomorrow it could be $19.99, who knows. Overall, an excellent printer, in a good looking, VERY heavy, plastic housing. If you don't care about anything else about this printer, except that you want perfect, professional looking print, at a reasonably priced small office printer, this is your man (printer). Lexmark makes great printers, this is one of them, and my only major gripe was the screen, and the paper tray a minor gripe. Other than that, even my other printer I had for a few years because it always performed so well (from a very well known company that also makes good printers, and sold for around the same price as this), didn't print as well as this when it came to precision print. For the price, I'm impressed with the print, and worth the asking price (especially if they decide to do something with that screen!)",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LG9CZCCKIY1W?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,

This wasn’t the case with this wireless laser printer. First, let me say that I actually much prefer toner over ink cartridge printer. I think the quality is much better. In that, the Lexmark didn’t disappoint. The quality of the color printing was crisp and clean, just as I would hope for.It was an easy set up process, and I was able to get it going in very short time. It is on the heavy side, but when you stop to consider that it has 4 separate cartridges, one for each of the CMYK, that can be expected. It is also loud when winding up and printing, although it sits quietly once it is all settled until, until you print. Again, not unexpected for laser printer.It does print pretty quickly, which is a bonus, but I feel that it is not all together as sturdily made as I would like. I feel sometimes that I have to be extra careful not to break some of the flimsier pieces, which sadly are ones that would have to be moved more often for replacing toner, etc.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38NG82GBK4NTD?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,1,0,No,

Once connected, the Lexmark C3426dw Color Laser Printer is easy to use, adjust and do everything I want with a printer. However, in attempting to make a wireless connection, I was stymied at every turn. I use a Macintosh computer — an iMac with a MacOS 10.15.4 Catalina operating system. It's the latest, but it's not a brand new OS—been around for a year...maybe a little less. When I began setting up the printer for a wireless connection, I followed the steps, but at some point in the process, I was told that I needed new firmware to continue. I downloaded the Lexmark Virtual Solution Center Plugin to update the firmware and went to open the .dmg file with the app, and was told by my computer that it could not be opened because ""Apple cannot check it for malicious software"" and directed me to contact the app-maker. At that point I was ready to give up, but I had a cable that I could physically connect to my iMac via the USB port to a port on the Lexmark. I did so, and presto! Everything worked fine; except for the fact that I cannot use it with WiFi. In the past, my wife and I shared a printer using WiFi, but not with this new Lexmark even though past Lexmarks we've owned worked fine with WiFi connections. Lest one groan ...

RPOUCI39DP6RG,"April 6, 2020",V-TEAM,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,High Performance Monochrome Printer Ideal for Remotely Supported Small Office or Workgroup,"What makes this printer stand apart from other monochrome laser printers is its emphasis on “Full Spectrum Security” and networking features that support remote management. If you are looking for a printer to be managed and supported from a remote location, this printer has unique features that support that objective.I purchased this printer to replace a worn out nine-year-old networked monochrome laser printer in a home office. This printer fulfilled that requirement providing excellent speed, print quality, and printing features. I was surprised by the many networking and security features provided by this printer; many more than needed for my use case. Many of these features appear similar to those found in department level printers used by large corporations to handle the printing needs of many employees where reporting the printer’s status, supply levels, and user access info to remotely located IT personnel is required and/or desired.This printer is a new offering from Lexmark and detailed information (beyond the product description on Amazon) is not yet available on the Lexmark website as of this review (early April 2020). Once this information becomes available, it should be possible to better understand the optimum use case for this printer and evaluate it more thoroughly. My current observations are based on reviewing the menu and setting options provided using the printer’s built-in web server.For now, here are some general setup observations:The box contains the printer (including starter toner cartridge), power cord, a one-page instruction sheet, and a software CD (for MS Windows – however, NOT required for Windows 10).The purpose of the instruction sheet is to walk one through initially preparing the printer to be use by ensuring the removal of shipping related packaging and loading the printer with paper. That is the extent of its value.As this printer is clearly intended be a networked printer (Wired Ethernet or Wireless), I will discuss its use in that context.This printer works out of the box with Linux, Windows 10, and Mac without loading any additional software from Lexmark. Wired setup just involves plugging in an ethernet cable provided by you and connected to your network. Wirelessly connecting to your network is accomplished using the setup provided display window & buttons on the printer.Once the printer has acquired its IP address from the network’s DHCP server, the address will be shown on the printer’s display. With the IP address assigned, the printer can now be installed and accessed by other devices on present on the network.Windows 10 installation simply involves using the add printer feature and selecting the network printer from the menu. Older versions of Windows will require driver installation. This can be accomplished using the CD included with the printer or by downloading the “Lexmark Printer Software G4 Driver and Software” from lexmark.com. Both the CD and download software package contain: Lexmark Installer, HBP drivers, Lexmark Scan driver, Lexmark Fax driver, Lexmark Status Center and Phonebook application. My personal recommendation is to use Windows 10 built in support for this printer and not install this software package.Mac Computers are supported by Bonjour and AirPrint on this printer. In Mac’s system preferences – printers, you can add the Lexmark B3342dw off the menu. Any iOS device (iPhone / iPad) will be able to AirPrint to this printer by selecting it on the iOS device. No installation of additional software is required.The Lexmark B3342dw contains a Web Server that can be accessed using the printer’s IP address and any internet browser on the network. Simply enter the IP address into the browser’s address window and you will be connected to the Printer’s server. There you will find an elaborate menu structure allowing you to configure and view the many features of this printer.Now, for the not so good news (as of early April.) The Lexmark site does not currently recognize this printer’s model number or provide any support information. I was, however, able to register the printer to my Lexmark account. Neither Amazon, Lexmark, or any other source has toner available for this printer. There isn’t any information about when/if toner will become available. The printer was supplied with a starter (approx. 500 sheet) cartridge. Hopefully this situation is only temporary.I strongly recommend waiting for available toner cartridges prior to purchasing this printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPOUCI39DP6RG?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,3,0,No,
R1EARTFHZLR1C9,"April 1, 2020",Bebe Blondell,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Great printer but setup issues...,"Great simple monochrome (black & white) laser printer. I got it to print work orders and documents so I don’t waste expensive inkjet ink on them. It works just as advertised. I had a little trouble getting it setup to print from my laptop over WiFi. There are no instructions with the printer and none available online. You basically get a piece of paper with cryptic images that go through the printer unpacking and setup but no detailed instructions on how it operates. The setup of connecting over WiFi is done through the a simple screen with 3 buttons. You need to scan through all of the functions and then through the alphabet to enter password. It's time consuming and frustrating that they didn't make a better way to do this. The printer ended up connecting to my home WiFi network without a problem but would not allow printing through my PC. It showed up in the Windows printer list several times and would bounce between “ready” and “error” states. I finally was able to determine which printer was the correct one in my settings and delete the others. After that it works fine. I also connected via Ethernet for testing and that also worked fine. Also had an issue printing from Apple iPhones or iPads. The phone would show and “out of paper” error on it even though the tray was full and printer was online. Ultimately, I found a work around where you change the paper from “letter” to “letter, plain paper” and it will print fine. So it looks like there are a few bugs to be worked out still on the part of the manufacturer. I still give this printer a solid 4 stars for price, quality and the fact that it does just what it’s supposed to which is quickly print black and white documents inexpensively. Just be prepared to work though some issues with the initial setup.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EARTFHZLR1C9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,

As I mentioned above, Lexmark makes great stuff and this printer is no different.In sum, this is a great option for the home or small business.

RH9GU757CDJQ9,"June 28, 2020",Jimster480,4,B3340dw,Vine Customer,A fast printer with an easy setup but a weird amount of network usage,"I setup this printer to replace my 6 year old $50 laser that has been chugging along faithfully. I've tested out a few other printers in the last months but this one is my favorite so far.The Good:- Has double sided printing (has to be a 2 page + document though)- Very fast printing (wake up to print time is around 14 seconds, only around 4 seconds if its on ""sleep"") and definitely hits its 40ppm claim. I did print out over 20 sheets for my son (single sided) in one clip and it was done in under 1 minute (including warm up time from ""sleep).- The printer Has Ethernet and a screen where everything can be setup without a PC even if it takes a little while on the 2 line screen. I was able to plug it into my network and get it working via the printer only in about 5 minutes.- Print Quality is very good; much better than my old $50 laser which is impressive considering how fast it spits the pages out!- Large Paper Tray; Holds 250 sheets and actually has a meter that tells you how much paper there is (in 3 different tiers of full, Nearly Full, OK) in the printer. Paper tray can be adjusted to various different types of paper so cards and other smaller formats can be printed.- Has a 50 sheet bypass tray in the back for separate paper types.- Drivers make it easy to setup duplexing and paper sizes.- Allows for PIN based print and hold features for offices; so users can print confidential documents that they will need to enter a pin to physically print out (printer will hold the print job in memory until it is retrieved).- Supports PCL5e; great for workgroups and other network printing scenarios.- Supports Wifi-Direct; this allows for direct printing from laptops or mobile devices without needing to be on the local network. You can enable to disable this in the options menu.- Supports Google Cloud Print: It can be toggled with a single button in the operator menu.- Super easy website user interface; Every area has easy drop down options and even firmware can be easily updated with a couple clicks via this page (printer local IP address). Check the included image to see what the page looks like.- Supports 500+ page paper trays or multiple paper trays. There is a whole family of printers from Lexmark that share paper trays; giving you many options to expand your paper capacity if need be.Cons- Has a coil whine that repeats 2x/second when its on ""sleep"" mode; must put printer into hibernate (which takes between 30-40 seconds to wake up) to make this go away.- Default windows driver install on a ""detected"" printer only contains the MAC address and not the name of the printer. Also has weird printing limitations and doesn't work properly. Drivers from the website are required to fix this.- 2 Line screen has poor viewing angles requiring you to be over the top of the printer to view it.- Rear Bypass tray requires Printer to not be near a wall. You need a full foot + behind the printer to be able to use it. Making it pretty useless in most applications since the power, ethernet, USB connections are around the bypass tray.- Uses a bunch of data on the network; I logged over 300MB in a day of data transfer without any printing. This seems to happen even when its on hibernate. My other printers use less than 1MB a day of data. I am not sure why this printer keeps sending 200kb every minute or so.Conclusion:I think I will be keeping this one to use it for my kids. Toner prices are decent with 3000 page toner cartridges available for under $90 (at the time of writing) and 1500 page ones available under $60.Considering the price of toner for some other printers on the market; this is both affordable and competitive.Overall this is a great printer for the money; it is very fast, prints with great quality and has a smaller form factor. Unlike other printers I have tested; this one I can actually recommend. It seems to also go on sale pretty frequently; meaning that you might be able to pick it up at an even better deal than the regular price.If this review helped you at all; please mark it helpful!

RTK9V316GMLB3,"July 31, 2019",Scott McElhiney,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,"Good quality, check out cost of replacement toner","This was super easy to setup, I followed the pictures in the instructions for removing all the tape strips etc... plugged it in and used the USB to my desktop. Didn't need that though as it also setup the wifi to my network via the keyboard (could have used a mobile app on my phone), with me just pushing the button on my cable router and it found it and made a secure connection in seconds. Probably the second thing I've ever had connect where I didn't have to go through punching in a long password with correct capital letters and is that a 1 or a i or an L? I printed a test page and it did it fast and very high quality. Then I took one of my photographic pieces of artwork and laid it in the scanner bed and copied it. The only dramatic difference I see between the professional print and the copy is due to using paper that is more like parchment so I have texture rather than a glossy print. I don't believe anyone would purchase this for printing artwork, but in a pinch it'll due without leaving a horribly colored print with lines.It's size is what one would expect from a modern all in one... this is substantial, but not an office printer for those collating hundreds of copies of large documents at a time. Only one drawer for paper, so changing paper type will involve removing and reloading with whatever you need.It does two sided duplex printing automatically, so you don't have to reload paper, that is a nice feature. And you can send stuff to this pretty much any way imaginable, wi-fi, usb, ethernet, including through a few apps from your Apple or Android products.It also still includes FAX capability, something I haven't tried out because I haven't had a landline in years. It can email scans to your devices which I suspect will get used a lot more than the FAX machine part, but if you are in a business that still sends or recieves faxes, just plug in and it asks for the business name and phone number to configure itself. If you run a small office, that has a land line, I know that people pay for that when they NEED to send something by fax, so a potential profit center.The only downside I see to this is the cost of supplies. If you buy the cartridges for 2500 color copies from Lexmark with their return program supplies, it's $99.99 per color cartridge and there are three of those. 3000 pages for the black cartridge and it's $96.99. Their website shows them all on backorder, so hopefully as this printer penetrates the market, the price of supplies drops and availability increases.Given the choice between brands, the only one in the modern market I do not like is the one that times out it's supplies and lacks good support... and that isn't this. I've had good luck with Lexmark products in the past and this looks like a contender, just compare cost of supplies before jumping in.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTK9V316GMLB3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,6,0,No,
R291OJN6PJCTIT,"September 18, 2019",J. Peplinski,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Powerful and heavy,"I got this for home use, but it's really somewhere between a home printer and an office printer. Typically most people don't use a laser printer at home because the replacement toner is so crazy expensive, but this isn't enough printer for a huge office either. Maybe a very small business, even a home business? It definitely yields very professional results.It took me a little while to get it set up, as I don't have a disc drive (it comes with an install disc, but for some of us that's not helpful). The enclosed instructions were not very helpful, and the on-board touchscreen wanted me to set it up for mobile using my phone, then did not provide the correct QR code or series of numbers for me to get it working. Finally I did a manual driver search using my computer's install-printer settings. Even that was a little more complex than usual because it wanted me to enter the printer's IP address manually; fortunately that number WAS on the little touchscreen, and after that it was smooth sailing.After the minor hiccups of setting it up, it worked fast and extremely well! I needed to print a full-color comic book page onto cardstock right away, and it spat it out in about 10 seconds looking absolutely perfect. I understand I'll run out of toner in about a week if I make that a habit, but it is nice to have that capability when I need it! So far it has printed very crisp, professional looking documents, and the full color prints have been absolutely flawless.It is a little larger than my inkjet (which admittedly is a big, multi-function inkjet) and it is A LOT HEAVIER. So be sure you have a good printer stand for it, because it needs it's own place. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone and everyone for home use, as it is a whole lot of printer for just the occasional job. But if you need excellent quality printing and are able to pay for supplies, this is a very solid model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R291OJN6PJCTIT?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,0,0,No,
R1CNBRTS6Y639V,"September 16, 2019",Dave Cunningham,2,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Mediocre office printer,"The main reasons this Lexmark doesn't get high marks from me: the setup is not as quick and easy as other printers I've had, and the color printing is only mediocre. I sometimes print photos and images on blank DVD disks, and I love that my Canon printer can do that in a very high-quality way. This Lexmark, not so much. Also, it's considerably larger than my Canon.It does spit out pages fairly quickly, about one every 3 seconds, and if you just need black and white document copies, this is a good printer for that. It's really best suited for office work.Another downside is that the toner is quite expensive. I was hoping to find a generic toner that would be compatible, but apparently none such exists yet. I know people who much prefer laser printers to inkjet, and perhaps it will last longer than my Canon inkjet printer -- I have gone through three inkjets in the last eight years -- but I still prefer the nice quality color printing of an inkjet.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CNBRTS6Y639V?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,0,0,No,

R2QGCPEHD3BGXH,"August 15, 2019",Dora Explorer,4,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Great printer for small business or a busy household,"I'll start by saying that we are using this printer at home.*PrintingThe printer starts up and prints very quickly, even from being fully asleep. Black and white print quality is very good. The text is very crisp and dark. Color printing is great for say printing web pages and colorful items such as that. For pictures it’s passable, but it’s not the kind of stuff you are going to print out and put into a picture frame. As long as you are printing on the front of the page only it spits the pages out very fast. If you do two sided it has to suck the page back into the printer which takes much longer. All printers that do duplex do this, so this is not specific to this printer though.We have had the printer be picky about the paper it picks up. There was one certain batch of paper (and we do not remember where it came from, sorry) that it had trouble picking up and jammed once and printed crooked on the rest. Everything else we have fed it has been fine.*ScanningThe scanning seems to be pretty good. The automatic document feeder is a very nice feature, and is something we considered essential – I’m too old to stand there and swap pages manually.Another nice thing about the scanner is that it functions on its own. Some lesser printers require software on a computer and the devices have to be connected and all that in order to scan things. This is a pain and never works well for me. With the Lexmark printer though, you can email the scan jobs and as long as you have the email server set up it requires no computer or additional setup.It’s not immediately obvious, but if you set up what the printer calls a shortcut, that’s basically the address book for the scanner. Also, this is 10x easier to set up if you go to the web page of the printer. It can be done from the front panel but typing on the keyboard is a little painful. Just go to the IP of the printer in your web browser and you can set that up much easier.*Software and DriversThere is also an app that helps you set up wireless and such for the printer. It wasn’t great but it got the job done, just follow the instructions.We have android phones and used the android print plugin. It has low ratings in the play store, but for us it worked well without any issues at all.The latest version of windows 10 found the printer but did not have a driver to print with. If you go to the Lexmark website and type in the printer name, there’s a small download that will install drivers and find the printer and everything seems to work OK.For a mac, I was a little concerned when there wasn’t any mac version of the printer driver to download at first. When I tried to add it anyway I realized that the printer speaks airprint/bonjour and the printer was immediately found and added with no drama whatsoever.*Aesthetics/Fit and finishThe printer is a decent sized one, it’s bigger than most consumer printers, but it’s not huge. It feels well built and does not feel cheap or flimsy.The screen is touch and works very well, with intuitive menus and plenty of options. When you are using the keyboard things get a little tedious, but it does work and works well enough to actually use.The paper tray holds a fair amount of paper, and a nice feature is the printer knows how much paper is in the tray and when you look at “supplies” under the printer driver or in the web page, it will give you a useful indicator of the amount of paper.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGCPEHD3BGXH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,5,1,No,

This printer is about the same size as my old inkjet, but it is a bit heavier. I think the extra weight must equate to extra quality, because this printer is superior to every printer that I have ever owned. The setup instructions were a numbered set of pictures to follow. Once it was unboxed and plugged in, I simply turned it on and followed the on screen instructions.

R21NOJFP9M5O7L,"August 2, 2019",Shane O. Laake,5,MC3326adwe,Vine Customer,Rather compact and very capable for the price,"The box that the unit shipped in was rather large, though when you remove the foam padding and consider that this is a color laser all in one with duplexing and a sheet feeder, it's rather compact. Setup starts with removing from the aforementioned foam, removing a large bag, and removing a bunch of tear away strips. Note there are pull tabs on all of the toner cartridges as well.Software setup can be completed via an app on your phone, but not if you're rocking the ethernet (which I prefer). Web download of the latest drive is a bit of a pain, as Lexmark uses the whole separate support page vs sales page strategy. The latter comes up first in any searches, but clicking support dumps you at the main support page. Boo! Once you find the software/drivers, it's also a bit of a miss, as I needed to specify my OS and 32/64 bitness, which is very 2009, and not 2019.That aside, the software installed easily, and it defaulted to not sending info back to lexmark--kudos! This thing prints crazy fast--go back to the last sentence and read this thing prints, and that's how long it took to do a full color portrait. Granted this isn't a photo printer, but it'll meet every need short of that expectation. My last home color laser was an OG four pass model, so this is such a revelation! The quality of print is also equal to the task.I don't do a lot of scanning, but it does a solid job, and the feeder is greatly appreciated (the limited scanning I do tends to be multipages documents I've signed). I haven't (and won't) use the fax. Copies are quite snappy!All in all, I love this printer. So much nicer than any inkjet! Toner doesn't bleed, and it's so fast. I haven't used this one enough to speak to reliability, but for now, assume it's spot on (I'll update if/when it isn't).Highly recommended",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21NOJFP9M5O7L?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,4,0,No,

R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ,"July 29, 2019",Just Plain Larry,3,MB2236adwe,Vine Customer,3 stars and I'll explain in the review WHY only 3,"===Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.===Review begins:Just a heads up since some people may miss this. Monochrome= black and white printing ONLY. This is NOT a color laser printerThis has the POTENTIAL to be a great printer but there are several things that caused me to deduct pointsPROS:1. Good print speed. I did a 50 page double sided document in less than 2 minutes.2. 3 ways to connect. Wireless, Ethernet or USB3. Good scanning speed. I scanned a 20 page document in 40 seconds. And it WILL scan to a color document, it just won't PRINT in color.4. Compact and lightweight. At 16.5"" W x 13"" D x 14"" high it will fit almost anywhere. And at 16 pounds weight, it is a breeze to carry around. If you are old school like me, and you remember the early lasers that required 2 men, a horse and a hoist to put in place, you will appreciate the lightweight of this product5. Automatic Duplex Printing. You don't have to wait for it to print the odd numbered pages, and then reload the first prints for the even numbered pages. It automatically pulls the sheet back and prints the second side6. 250 page paper tray. Not nearly as much paper loading. And it handles letter and LEGAL size easily.6. At 5% toner lay down, you get crisp clear sharp text.7. Starter cartridge included.8. Built-n Web Server so you can check on status, jobs, level of supplies etc.9. It's multi-function so you can fax, scan, copy or print.10. When it's done for the day, it takes you out to dinner. OK not really, but it does a lot of things.So with all that, why only 3 stars you ask?1. The setup guide is a pictograph, not text.2. There is no manual included in the box or on the CD. I can understand not including a 187 page manual on paper, but they could have at least included the manual in PDF format on the CD. I had to go to support.lexmark.com to get the manual.3. It has a separate imaging unit from the toner cartridge. The unit is rated for 12,000 pages. We don't usually print that much in a year, but what about folks who print 3,000 pages a month? Every 4 months you will have to replace the imaging unit.4. And now, My BIGGEST gripe about this product. TONER COST!!!!!!!! Unless you are willing to participate in their Return program, which means you buy the cartridge and only use it once you can expect to pay $275-$350 for an extra high yield cartridge (6,000 pages) and from $90-$150 for a regular cartridge (1,200 pages) . And even on the return program for a regular yield (1,200 pages) they start at $48 depending on where you shop for it.Between having to replace toner, and having an external imaging unit, I don't care that it takes you out for dinner (again, just kidding). The operating costs for this product are too high for every day usage except in a small office. I was hoping to retire my old HP 1020, but that isn't going to happen until the consumable costs come way down. This printer is a fairly new release, so it is hard to find remanufactured consumables yet.So if you can overlook the consumables cost, then this is a good printer for daily use, even if it is not economical to use. The output is clear and sharp. Scanner works great. I did not test the fax since our fax server is in another room from the printer. Fast printing. Fast scanning. Wi-Fi enabled. Mid-point price range. Ethernet ready. USB Front port for printing from a flash drive. Network capable. USB Ready as well. Color control panel that's large enough to work with. Compact design and weight.But I am still only giving it 3 stars for the consumables cost.End of Review===Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

I've set it up in home home office where I am constantly printing and faxing documents throughout the day. The machine was pretty simple to get setup on my WiFi network using the Lexmark Mobile setup app available on apple and android. I suggest using the app as it's much easier than typing on the small touchscreen.The touchscreen responds quickly and is visually appealing. It can be customized with most frequently used features such as scan, fax and email. PC drivers and software was easy to install and had no issues setting up on my 2 laptops and my desktop. I can seamlessly print from all of my devices and applications.Faxing is a breeze using the top loading self feeder tray. Once the fax task is complete the machine prints out a fax log which includes your cover page (or whatever your first page was) along with the status, time, page count and number sent to.Scanning can be done from the auto feeder tray or the flat panel (I prefer the auto feeder). Print quality is outstanding, crisp clear printing every time and super fast. I formerly used an ink-jet all in one and printing took forever. The only downside I've noticed is with scanning files to a PC or mobile device. My previous machine I could put my documents into the feeder, sit at my desk and just scan to my computer or mobile device. After scanning I could tweak if needed, send as email etc.With this Lexmark when you scan from a PC or mobile device it makes you ""approve"" the job on the printer itself which to me defeats the purpose of scanning from my PC if I have to go back to the printer to OK the scan. Something I hope a software or firmware patch can fix.Overall This multi-function laser printer is a great investment and makes daily tasks much faster without reducing quality.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IMHTZMA01DA1?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,0,0,No,

Does what is expected, with two caveats:1. Missing auto-duplex ADF scanning - the scanner document feeder will only scan one side and then the paper must be re-fed after flipping over. Not sure why you would even make an ADF without auto-duplex, it kills your efficiency.2. Windows 10 drivers need to be loaded from enclosed CD. They are not built in to Windows (like every other printer that I have ever had), and not easy to find on the Lexmark website.

R1CFP7Y6DEZ204,"August 25, 2019",Keogh,5,MB2236adwe,Vine Customer,Excellent printer,"The Lexmark MB2236adwe is a very good printer with a few blips that aren't excessively detrimental. I use it regularly everyday with complete satisfaction.Packaging is quite good with a foam shell encasing the printer, all movable components are thoroughly secured with tape and the entire bundle covered in a plastic bag. The included instruction booklet is a little minimalist and it does not come with a printer cable. Most annoying is actually the included software CD, I haven't used discs in over a decade and all my rigs are custom built so the disc is useless and the online support site is not friendly for support. The adwe version of the MB2236 is not actively supported at this time and checking the other versions only provided a driver for 1 of them, no software at all. I noticed the CD said G4 lexmark software and a quick search found me a downloadable version that works perfectly but for some reason it's not on the MB2236 support pages.Setup is a little rough depending on your networking capabilities. I hoped for a more user friendly setup. I've been building my own computers for 20 years and while networking is not my strong point I'm not a complete novice. The flexibility with this unit means there's tons of options to deal with and the unit didn't come plug n' play, it had to have the network setup to connect wirelessly and I found the G4 software was necessary for regular, continuous use. Just the driver installed allowed me to print initially but afterwards, say after restarting, the printer wouldn't auto connect or even register as online/available. With the G4 software I can print whenever without issue.Print quality is excellent, the printer is quite capable and does 2 sided printing with ease even from the copy function. Copy quality is good and overall speed is pretty good. I set the unit to wake, print, go back to sleep and it does so flawlessly. I have noticed the noise it makes while printing is a little clunky, while the printer performs admirably and professionally, that noise makes it sound a bit on the cheap and flimsy side though nothing else about it instills those feelings.Lastly, the ink cartridges are on the expensive side. I have bought many toner cartridges for most of the major brands and this one is about twice the cost of the equivalent version of the brand I use at work. Overall, once you get past the setup hurdles it's a great printer that does a lot of stuff and does them well. I am a long time fan of Lexmark, having never had problems with them and appreciating the quality. I am not disappointed with this unit at all, I wish the ink was more in-line cost wise with other brands but it's a solid product that I'm glad I ordered.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CFP7Y6DEZ204?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,8,0,No,

R1120UPLV1XOIE,"April 16, 2020",Dr. Stuart Gitlow,5,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,Easy setup. Excellent single pass full duplex scanner. Crisp clear color output.,"Unpacking: A few sheets of setup illustrations, an AC cord, a CD-ROM which was unnecessary for my Mac based installation, and the printer. Easy enough for one person to handle and one of the lighter full color laser printers I've handled.Setup: Usual Lexmark ease. Run the Lexmark app on your smartphone, connect to the printer, and then set up the printer with your home wifi network. Everything worked immediately thereafter and I could check from my computer to see whether the paper bin is full and how much toner remains in each cartridge. I noted that there's a side door for easy access to the excess toner collection module.Operation: Running with a Mac Pro and System 10.15.4, everything works smoothly and correctly. Very reasonably quiet operation, quick first print time, bright crisp color, and incredibly pleased by the single-pass duplex scanning capability. This latter feature is often overlooked but definitely makes quick work of scanning double-sided material. Note that many products have only single-side capability, and some have double-pass duplex capability, meaning they have to scan one side, flip the sheet, scan the other side, then flip it again to discharge it in the correct orientation. That takes forever when you're scanning a pile. This scanner brings in both sides simultaneously - quick, easy, and so far I've had no problems with the feed mechanism.The color touchscreen works properly and can be set up through Preferences to display only the commands that you want readily available. There's a small feeder so that you can put envelopes in without having to reload the single paper tray. And best yet, in my mind, is that you put paper into the tray in the same orientation that you want it printed - that is, the print will appear upright on the same side of the paper that faces up. So you never have to think to yourself as you put in letterhead how to get the orientation correct. Wonderful, and one of very few printers where this is the case.Build quality is excellent.

I'm tired of the inks either running out quick or the missing spots of printing. This was easy to setup for the most part after taking all the shipping tape off the printer. I did all the installation through the lexmark app.This was great because the lcd screen is way too small. It is a touch screen but its too small for a 2020 printer. The touch screen does let you select copy, fax etc when needed. The top feeder is excellent and the scanner made great copies, nice and clear.Its little on the noisy side but once the print comes out the unit shuts down fast so its quick to print and quiet again.The inks are very easy to remove when needed. the front is a flap that drops down and the inks are in a drawer that you pull out. Very easy!Print quality is nice but the colors were running on the green side for me. I'm also not able to tweet any settings because i'm using a mac. The supplied software disc is only for windows. Their online download section does NOT have anything for this model for mac os x.So while you can print and use all the functions you cannot do any adjustments from what i can tell as of yet. Hopefully soon there will be a mac version which i'm sure will come soon.Printing can also be done via iPad/iphone too. just download the mobile printing app. Note...make sure your devices are on the same network wifi as the printer or it won't show up as an available printer choice.

If you've ever picked up a drug prescription chances are it was printed on a Lexmark printer so they have a good reputation overall.All that aside I feel like I'm critical of printers because modern day printers kind of suck. I've been through a number of them over the last few years and only an old Epson laser printer has held up. Printers are cheap and used as delivery devices for consumers to buy print supplies. That said, I'll do my best to update this review if anything changes.The MC3426adw is a heavy printer with the box weighing in at over 40 lbs. Once unpacked it's a simple matter of removing the packing material and all of the tape. Plug it in, start it up, and you're in business. The interface on the little LED screen itself is easy to figure out, and it's a good thing because there is very little documentation. You won't need it for setup, anyway.There's an app that you can use to test prints. I grabbed a few images off my phone and they printed without issue and very quickly. There's also a Lexmark cloud that you can store and print from.The print cartridges are beefy and will probably be expensive to replace, so hopefully they last for a long time.This is a big and solid printer and I've had no issues at all after a month of use.

R2YVVW81VEBQQC,"May 1, 2020",Drew's Reviews,4,MC3426adw,Vine Customer,"Gorgeous Prints, Excellent 2 Sided Scanning & Easy Setup","While I have setup and used laser printers in office settings this is the first laser printer I have had for home use.Laser printers have many advantages over inkjet, the primary of those being print quality and speed. The disadvantage, and reason they are used less often in home settings, is purchase price and toner cost.This Lexmark MC3426adw printer is standard size for similar workstation units and comes with everything you’ll need to get it setup and running.While it came with an installation CD I opted for downloading the app and software which was easily located on the Lexmark website rather than pullout my external CDROM. The iOS app was easy to use and connected the workstation to my network without any issue.I work on a Windows 10 PC and had no problems whatsoever with setup and using all of the functions.I have put this workstation through a full battery of testing and I am thoroughly impressed with its capabilities. I have found the Dual Core, 1.0 GHz processor can handle any tasks I throw at it with ease.In terms of printing - text is printed crisp, clean and flawless. Speed of printing is incredible when compared to inkjet - really there is just no comparison. In addition it prints both sides of the page at the same time! Printing graphics, images and photos was likewise excellent. While I don’t typically print photos and instead upload them to professional photo services, I found the printed image quality far superior to anything I’d ever previously produced at home.When it comes to scanning, this workstation is a powerhouse of performance. It is able to scan both sides of a page at the same time allowing it to make short work of even large stacks of scanning jobs. The results of my scanning tests were very good and the speed is phenomenal.This workstation is highly versatile allowing for an expanded media tray to be added and high capacity toner cartridges if you have especially large projects. It is able to print on to envelopes and multiple sizes of media with no problem. It connects to the major cloud platforms and will easily upload and download with them. There is a built in USB port on the front for scanning to flash media and, of course, it’s available via Wifi or Ethernet.The only flaw I have found with this otherwise great product is the touch screen. On a device this size there is no reason for the touchscreen to be so minuscule. While I don’t find that I have to use the touchscreen often, when I do it’s difficult to key anything in without miskeying.While toner costs more than it would for an inkjet it is in line with other brands and is readily available. Each color in addition to black is individually packaged so you only change the cartridge that is needed without wasting the others.This is an outstanding color laser printer, scanner and fax machine that is made to perform.

If you can get the printer to work and stay connected to a network, the rest of my earlier review stand. I had to change routers, I could not reconnect to the new router. I tried chatting with their support who said they'd have someone call me. I got a call fxrom a tech who had difficulty understanding that the printer wasn't connecting to the network and asked to take control of my computer. I tried explaining one more time that the printer wasn't connected to the new router. He hung up on me. I chatted again (see photo), and the support person said she'd have someone call me but did not and canceled the chat. I called by the number and they answered and hung up on me again after putting me on hold. Then the next time I called back, they simply refused to answer the call. In addition to poor instructions, this is what you can expect from Lexmark,Moving back to HP, even at no charge, this is the most frustrating and expensive printer you'll ever own.Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a very advanced computer and network user, I owned a computer store for years.First the good.Once you get the printer set up and connected to the network the print quality is very good. The printer prints fast and even on standard copy paper does a very nice job of printing. It's also reasonably quiet which I enjoyed a lot.Copying on the printer is also relatively easy and works very well. I haven't tried the fax simply because I use an app to scan everything now and send it via email or hellosign.Now the not so good.First, the instructions are ridiculous. You get a about 7 pages of paper with no words, just photos and a CD. Honestly, who still has a CD drive on their computer? They need to either switch to a thumb drive or just tell you where to go to download manuals and let you know to do it online.The actual unboxing and setup itself is relatively straight forward, it's when you get to needing to type on the keypad that things start going south. Unless your fingers are the size of an infant's, it is very difficult to accurately type on the tiny touch keypad on the screen of the printer. It literally took me 11 tries to get the passwords to match because you can't see what you are typing, only dots.Connecting to the network took a few tries, again, because there are not clear instructions included nor onscreen instructions. Once I was connected, I needed to update my Apple computer to connect and that process was pretty painless.I downloaded their app and so far it is nearly useless. I can't print from Google docs and there are favorites I can theoretically add but haven't been able to get them to work yet.I would not recommend this printer to anyone who isn't at least moderately tech savvy, HP has them beat by a mile in terms of setup overall.Supplies for the printer seem to be generally in line with what I'd expect.I feel like the printer is somewhat overpriced for what you get, especially when you factor in the pain of setting it up.I feel like this will be a good printer that will last a while and definitely get the job done but unless things change a lot between now and my next printer purchase, I'll probably go back to HP.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QFFOJ62ANPQ8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08411CN2Y,12,2,Yes,"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  Thank you for taking time to write a review.

The scan quality is excellent, and the software gives plenty of options for customizing my documents. My only issue was it took me a bit of time to download the app, but it was well worth it.I am extremely impressed with the speed of print for both black and color and the volume of pages for output.

R3KRCKVVDNC27R,"April 28, 2020",M. Gondek,3,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Tiny screen, loud, overpriced","This is my least favorite of several printers I've reviewed in the past couple of years. First, the good:1. Print quality is crisp, as you'd expect from a laser printer.2. Printing is fast. I don't feel like I'm hanging around, waiting for the printer to do its thing. That's after it's downloaded the data from WiFi, of course, which varies a lot by content.3. Small footprint. It really is a small machine, although it's deeper than an average bookshelf. It'll hang off the front or back, unlike other machines I've used that are wider (than deep).4. Reasonable setup. I installed from the DVD, although I suspect that wasn't necessary. It did install a very annoying pop-up ""information"" screen that also started appearing when I use my other Lexmark. I ended up uninstalling this, since it was useless and annoying.5. No problems with WiFi. It was set up and ready to go in a couple of minutes, and hasn't dropped or had any issues.Now the not-so-good:1. LOUD. When is was initializing, I thought it was about to take off for the moon, but it quieted down a little after that. Now it's just loud when... printing. It's easily the loudest printer I've used, so it's not a good choice if you're using it while on calls or otherwise don't want to listen to it all day.2. Tiny touchscreen. I have pretty small fingers (ladies size medium), and I had a heck of a time adding the WiFi password (for example). It's incredibly easy to fat-finger virtually everything, so using the screen is an exercise in patience and repetition (try again... try again...) That said, the touchscreen responds well.3. Flimsy build quality. The print drawer doesn't insert smoothly, and doesn't feel durable at all. All the hinges open/close slightly skewed, and take more effort than they should (and make me worry I'm going to break this thing). While flimsy printer drawers seem to be a Lexmark thing, I'd hoped they would improve on this for the new models. Nope.4. Way overpriced. The older MC series offers multi-functions at a cheaper price than this model. Since the touchscreen and print functions are the same on that series, I'm really not sure how the price of this single-function model is justified. It's just a printer. For a similar footprint and print experience, the MC series is a far better value.Recommended for: Someone who values a small footprint, doesn't mind the noise, and doesn't care about copying, faxing, or scanning, nor wants more than 1 print drawer. AND who doesn't mind paying more for this than a machine from the same company that has multi-functions in a similar footprint.Not recommended for: Everyone else",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KRCKVVDNC27R?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,6,0,No,

The physical setup of the machine was simple with one sheet of illustrated instructions that was easy to follow (although the printer’s control panel keys are very small and difficult to use). The printer software was also simple to install and upon completion I was rewarded with a printer test page indicating the printer was “correctly installed”.And then the “fun” began. Despite a confirmed connection between computer and printer, a number of trial printing jobs resulted in “communication failure” error messages. The brief version: a one-page Word file printed just fine; a one-page Excel file had long delays for a queue issue and then either failed to print or printed one-half of the page and a one-page slideshow image failed to print at all. Not being a techie, I tried some of the standard fixes for a couple of hours, but nothing worked.Finally, I reached out to Lexmark technical support. The good news is that I was connected immediately. However, after two hours on the phone with the technician – during which I provided them with remote control of my computer; I moved the printer from the other room so it could be hooked up via ethernet directly to the router; and I watched patiently as they seemed to repeat clicks/commands that had already failed to work. Finally, I addressed the technician and asked what the prospects were for a resolution since we had been on the phone for two hours. I was told I probably had a wi-fi problem (despite the fact that the printer was located literally next to an Epson Workforce, with which we have no wi-fi issues) and that they were still trying to fix it. I also reminded the technician that (per the printer control panel) the printer was receiving the documents – it just wasn’t printing them.So, at that point I called a halt to the process and resolved to just return the printer to the box it came in.

The few sheets of instructions (pictograph) were a little puzzling but mainly involved steps in unpacking and untaping the unit (the outside tapes had a little folded-over bit at the end that made it easy to pull off -- no digging your thumbnail in). The installation CD is helpful but you can also download the manual from the Lexmark website, which appears to be good about product support, and the touch screen on the unit is easy to use, esp. regarding the Wifi connection. You will need to download the Lexmark printer driver, although the generic Windows driver worked well enough. The printer itself, so far, has proven fast, with fine print quality and good functionality, both for single-side printing and 2-side (duplex).Also, I've noticed no noticeable inrush, that is, the sudden electrical demand that a lot of laser printers make on startup and printing. I've had to exile some older laser printers to the other side of the house after they knock other devices off the circuit -- but not this one.Some minor quibbles: this is a straightforward color printer, with no scan or other functions. It can handle a fair range of paper sizes and weights, but is not a photo-quality printer. Unpacking the unit can be a problem, the unit is big and heavy enough, and in an outer Amazon box can be difficult to carry any distance; however, if you take the product box out you'll find handle-openings in that box, and easier to carry.

R3OORQH2V2YHPH,"April 19, 2020",Blayne,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,Set up and printing wirelessly in under 10 minutes,"Review of: **Lexmark C3426dw Color Laser Printer**I literally unpacked this printer, set it up on its box on the floor, and was printing wirelessly from a laptop in under 10 minutes. No joke. All it required was to unpack the printer, follow the printed unpacking instructions to remove the tape and plastic protective tabs (I recommend using the printed instructions here because there were a set of shipping ""tabs"" in the print toner compartment that I would have missed), adding paper, and then following the manual on-screen setup prompts to get it online.I did use the WPS wifi config on my router to set this up. This is basically a simplified way to get the printer on your wireless network without even needing to enter the wifi password. I simply went through the setup on the printer, and then when it says to press the WPS button (within 120 seconds), press it (usually on the bottom of your router) and that was it. The printer was done configuring wireless. After the, a couple of steps to set the date/time/time zone, and I was done.Next, I added some paper to the tray and went into the Printer setup on my MacBook, picked the new Lexmark printer (it automatically appeared in the list of printers available), and I was done. I printed a page or two to test it, and also successfully printed from my iPhone X doing nothing more than selecting the Lexmark printer that automatically was listed as my (only) option to print (I don't have any other wireless printers online on my home network). Same story for my wife's laptop - absolutely seamless and simple setup.I have printed a few docs and other files so far, and am very impressed with the overall print quality. Sharp text, vibrant colors, and even pictures - which inexpensive laser printers are not really the best choice for printing on - look very good. And this is printing on stock office printer paper, nothing fancy. And I absolutely love having the option to print double-sided pages (duplex) without having to have the printer print on one side and then re-feed the paper into the printer upside down.Print speed is excellent, when warmed up this thing essentially prints instantly. When cold, it takes a few seconds - with a somewhat noisy fan kicking on - to get warmed up and then prints. Printing multiple pages is VERY fast for a light duty office printer. They claim 26ppm, or a page every ~2 seconds, and I have no doubt that is accurate.The only downsides I see are:-The printer is fairly heavy. The specs say about 35 pounds, but it almost feels heavier due to it's compact size.-Some of the construction feels a little cheap, in particular some of the plastic parts. When you open the toner door, you can feel a lot of flex in the plastic panel. And the plastic arms that allow the toner cartridge shelf to pull out feel very flimsy, like they would break if you pulled too hard. Nothing has actually broken yet, but some of these pieces could have been made of or reinforced with some metal.-There is no scanner. I know, this model is not sold as a MFP (multi-function printer), so I am not dinging it due to this. But keep it in mind if you need the option to use your printer as a copier.-The paper tray has to be extended out for legal size paper, making the depth of the printer a few inches more. (It took me a few minutes to figure out how this printer could accept legal size paper at all, like the product information states. The manual isn't very clear, but you need to extend the paper tray outward toward the front of the printer, and when you do this, the white plastic face plate actually sticks out further than when you are using letter size paper or smaller. If you want to print on 8.5x17 paper you have to use the manual feed slot just above the paper tray.)I cannot comment on how long the toner cartridges will last or the long term durability/reliability since I have only been using the printer for a few days. Should I discover anything in these areas that is an issue, I will update this review.From a print quality and performance, this gets a solid 5 stars for a ~$400 laser printer. I am dropping half of a one star from my overall rating due to the slight flimsiness in some of the plastic parts and the inability to handle paper larger than letter size from the print tray without making it stick out. That makes my overall rating 4.5 stars (rounding up to 5 for the Amazon review limitations).If you are looking for a solid laser print performer in a home office or small office with a small footprint, I highly recommend you consider this Lexmark C3426dw model.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OORQH2V2YHPH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B084117J9Z,6,0,No,
R35ZD0PWWYE2R1,"April 19, 2020",Walter,5,C3426dw,Vine Customer,"Good printer, a little difficult to setup","We needed a color printer for our office and thought this would be a good choice. The small footprint is a huge plus since we have limited space. The initial setup was easy enough using my wife’s Chromebook and the printer’s touchscreen. But we had to use the included CD before the Windows 10 laptops would recognize it. That slowed things down considerably.Out of the box there is a lot of tape and tags to be removed, but there is an instruction sheet with pictures to show you where to find them. There is also a cd containing an app that needed to be installed on each of our Windows laptops before they could find the printer. There were no other instructions. It some tinkering and about an hour to get all 3 Win10 laptops to print anything so some instructions would have been nice. There was a very bothersome SMTP error that wouldn’t go away even once the printer was printing. I had to reboot the laptop and unplug the printer to resolve the issue.Once the setup was complete everything went smoothly. The printer works just fine printing single or double-sided pages in black and white or in color. Printing is relatively silent. The speed is good, but not great at 26 ppm. Hopefully the toner lasts as long as Lexmark claims as the biggest drawback to any printer is the cost of running it.As for quality it does a great job with text and graphics, but I wouldn’t recommend it for photos. We tested it by printing our multicolor brochures that contain some colorful infographics and backgrounds. These looked quite nice and are much higher quality that the inkjet we were using. I also tried printing a couple of photos, but they were lack-luster and rather dull. My inkjet does a much better job in that regard.One note about shipping: while the Amazon box was in good condition, the printer box inside was damaged. Fortunately, the printer was not.So far so good. I have another Lexmark printer that we stopped using before the end of the first week because it couldn’t print even a single page job without jamming.

It was easy to set up, has decent features, and the print quality is good.Setup: cabled setup is easy, although if you're not going to go wireless, you'll have to supply your own cable, whether USB or Ethernet. I won't dock them for that, although they could have said ""cable not supplied"" in their writeups. This just worked out of the box on my Linux system. For Windows, you should probably download drivers from the Lexmark support site. Not sure about Mac.Wireless setup is accomplished from the little display window on the printer. I've always found this annoying but if you run Windows and want to install their software you can avoid this. But there is nothing hard about it, just a little tedium, and it works as it should, although I always prefer the Ethernet option. (Tip: on your router, assign a fixed IP address to the printer. This makes life easier for non-USB connections.)Okay, how does it work? Just fine. Double sided printing is wonderful, print quality is great, speed is about what you'd expect today--- in other words, very good for a home printer used by a few people. (Don't expect to use this in a 20 person office, though.) It's a light-duty printer, very suitable for a home office.Build quality is good. Don't drop it off tall buildings, but don't be afraid to move it around or carry it around. It should stand up just fine.Now, the one gripe. Toner. It comes with the plague of printers in pretty much the last decade, the dreaded ""starter"" cartridge. This is a cartridge that is maybe 10% full, meaning you have to buy a real cartridge almost right away. And guess what, the cartridge price is in the same range as the printer price in most cases. Manufacturers don't have to make money on the printer, they make it on the cartridge.The ""starter"" is supposed to be good for 500 pages, about one ream. If that holds up, depending on your needs, you might get a week or two in a busy home office, and maybe a month or two of really casual use.So you better order that cartridge. You go to the Lexmark site and ... oh my, they aren't selling them. Maybe a little later on? Better hope so, or pretty soon you'll have a brick. This is 100% inexcusable. And comparing similar Lexmark printers, the cartridge will be over a hundred dollars. Wow.Usually there are 3rd-party cartridges, often for about 15% of the price. That's what I always buy for my other printers; I find a reputable vendor and buy from them. But you cannot get the cartridge for this printer anywhere at the time of this writing (late March 2020).I'm going to provisionally rate the printer four stars. After all, it's a very good product. I would have gone five if the cartridges were available at a fair price. I will revisit this later. If in a month or two you still can't get the cartridge, the rating will be one star.Followup in June 2020: Toner is now available from the manufacturer (pretty expensive) and from at least one third party (a little less expensive but still not cheap).",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA4TT0RCQT8VK?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,11,0,No,

From sleep to first page out is under 10 seconds and pages print at the advertised speed, even using the duplexer, which I love. The picture instructions are bad, and there is nothing else, but once you get the printer out of the box they kind of make sense. This does not come with any cables other than power, so if you want to connect other than wirelessly you will need an Ethernet cable to connect to your network or a printer cable (with that squarish connector) to connect to your computer. I opted for wireless as I wanted to test this with my Android tablet as well. Once you power on the printer you have to use the 2-line monochrome screen to set it up (date, time, time zone, connect to network). Not terrible, but a user manual would have made it much better. Do note that if you connect to a network it has to be 2G and not 5G. The driver for this is not on the Lexmark site as of this review, so I had to use the CD (I tried with the Windows driver and the pages printed like a negative, but the Lexmark software fixed that). The Lexmark app installed fine on my Android tablet (Samsung) and I was able to print from there as well. This is a no-frills B&W laser, but it is the best one I've ever used.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU29785I48QOO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
RX72XBHQ26O0T,"March 16, 2020",Man in the Middle,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Very fast and works well. PC setup is easy. Mac setup is manual.,"The first thing I noticed on setting up this new printer is that it came with only one page of pictorial setup info, and no manual. It did include a driver CD, but my iMac running Catalina couldn't find any files it could run on that. In addition, searching the Lexmark website found no useful information about this new B3442dw model (though I did find a brochure about its likely predecessor, the B2442dw.)Fortunately, I was easily able to set the printer up properly anyway. Just remove all the packing materials both around the toner cartridge and on the outside of the case, load some paper, and power the printer on. A built-in small display will talk you through the needed initial settings, including entering a password to join your WiFi network. From there it was simple to tell my iMac to add a printer, and chose that one from the bonjour list that appeared. Once set up, its Options & Supplies button in the driver allows all other settings to be seen and customized easily.Since I do also have a Windows 10 laptop PC (Dell Inspiron XPS 15), I WAS quickly and easily able to install a driver on that, using the included CD.Once a driver was installed, printing on both the iMac and the Dell was a simple matter of choosing the Lexmark printer for a document. The result was blazingly fast (I've never seen such quick duplex printing before), and good quality.Overall, this is an excellent printer, lacking only a bit more attention to documentation to be fully ready for prime time on Macs in addition to Windows PCs.Update: Just discovered an interesting problem. For no obvious reason, the link to this printer at IP address 192.168.1.26 has also taken over the link to my Western Digital MyCloudEx2Ultra at IP address 192.168.1.2. Attempting to open a Web page at 192.168.1.2 shows the printer's web page, the same as if I'd opened the page at 192.168.1.26. And the MyCloud can't be accessed unless the printer is powered off. Those two addresses should NOT be in conflict, but somehow are. I'll update once I figure it out.Update 2: No toner is listed as available yet for this printer, either here at Amazon or at the maker's website. Whether the toner for the earlier model B2442dw would also work on this new model is unknown. The printer comes with a starter toner.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX72XBHQ26O0T?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R2558N1P0X0T8S,"March 15, 2020",Eric L.,4,B3442dw,Vine Customer,Full Featured Networkable Printer,"The printer does not seem to come with a USB cable. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one on hand or buy one. Or at least mine didn’t come with any cables other than power. That was ok for me because I am using Ethernet and I have a bunch of spare Ethernet cables, and there is also wireless connectivity available. But USB likely the easiest way to get up and running for non-techies, so if this is you, have a spare printer cable lying around, or purchase one with the printer. Same with the ethernet cable; if you want to connect this way, you’ll need to have an extra one or buy one.Once unpacked and set up following the crude pictograms included, it was necessary to download the drivers and install them. The unit does come with a CD installer disk, but even if you have an antique computer with an optical drive, it makes more sense to go to the Lexmark website and download the latest drivers. Who knows how old the ones on the CD are?After plugging the printer into my switch using Ethernet, and running the installer, the software could not find the printer, nor was it listed by my router as being connected (though the Ethernet activity lights on the printer were flashing). Eventually, I noticed that the small LCD display on the top of the printer had some questions about time, date, and language that must be answered on the printer before it will even show up on the network. After completing the setup on the small LCD screen, the printer was connected but the installer still could not find it. Instructions would have been helpful here, especially for people who aren’t technically inclined, but you can probably find help online.It was necessary for me to go to my router’s web page, get the printer’s DHCP provided IP address, and plug that into the installer manually in the “advanced set up” area. Also, it asks for you to manually type in the port name. I typed in “Ethernet” (no quotes) and it worked, the installer was able to proceed. After doing this on my main computer, I went back to the router and assigned a fixed IP address to the printer so that I will have no trouble finding it when I install the driver on my laptop and other computers.The software itself is nice and compact. I have a Canon printer that came with software that’s all up in your face all the time… meaning, it came with a bunch of bloatware like scrapbooking apps and card making apps and a bunch of docks and control panels that I had to carefully remove after writing the review. In the case of this Lexmark, it’s all business and it’s not in your face at all, and I appreciate that.The printer is fast and quiet. Over Ethernet, when I send a page the printer, it’s done printing before I can even start wondering how long it will take. Coming from an inkjet printer, this is really nice. Also, the network connectivity is indispensable these days. It certainly is if you have two or more devices in your life that you’d like to print from. That network connectivity also makes it easy to tweak the settings as the printer publishes a web page that you can reach from any web browser (if connected to from your local network). Just type the IP address of the printer into your browser and the settings page comes up. By the way, this is another good reason to assign a static IP to the printer; you can then just add a bookmark to your browser. That administrative web page allows you to change many parameters in several categories. Some of the settings are beyond my paltry comprehension, but there is a lot there that is useful to me, and some of it I’m sure is useful to IT personnel deploying these things on larger networks. There are a lot of IT tweaks and settings available here.The printer is handsome looking and compact, and it feels durable and professional. I think it will be perfect for my home office. Every computer I have can now print quickly and quietly from anywhere in the house.The unit comes with a toner cartridge that is described as a “starter cartridge.” It’s not clear to me how many pages we will get out of this; also, at the time of writing this, I couldn’t find replacement cartridges on Amazon or on the Lexmark site. No doubt they will be rolling these out soon; I just hope it’s sooner than my “starter cartridge” lasts. When available, I expect the replacement cartridges to cost well north of $100 each.I remember when laser printers cost a couple thousand dollars each, and then you had to pay extra for network connectivity. The price of this one is very appealing. In fact, it seems like a steal at this price. Just don’t forget that they get you on the toner, same as inkjet makers get you on the ink. There’s still no free lunch.Other than that, I’m delighted with this little printer. It really is quite perfect for a small office.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2558N1P0X0T8S?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,0,0,No,
R10V9WCIQS76AL,"March 14, 2020",Summit,1,B3442dw,Vine Customer,"FAST! Love it!  ***UPDATED: Didn't last through starter toner...  it's dead, Jim!","*********EDITED MAY 2020: It didn't make it through the tiny starter toner. It connects to the network, it just refuses to print with no indication why. I'm a retired network engineer and have dealt with the nastiest of printer problems on networks and repaired printers in the field with paperclips, soldering iron and sheer anger. This one stopped working rather early on and can only print it's own configuration- no other print jobs will work and nothing more of an error than it just ""can't print"" the job. My last Lexmark was an utter failure, too... and this one will now join it as I have to PAY to recycle them both. As of today, replacement toner is not available anywhere- even from Lexmark unless I mail in the empty one first to refill. I'm done with Lexmark after decades of buying dozens and dozens of their enterprise printers at a time.**************This is a no-frills, monochrome printer without all the fancy touch-screen nonsense. What it does, it does perfectly- spit out paper quickly.I print a LOT while I'm working on some business plans, consulting and getting my MBA just for giggles despite being retired. My color laser eats toner as if it is free and it most certainly isn't. Having a monochrome, fast, two-sided printer as a default is the best idea ever... save that color printing for when it's actually necessary. It's surprising how often one does NOT need color, and the cost savings of not wasting printing in color is significant.I set this up without looking at directions, as I always do. Initially, it didn't detect ANY WiFi networks in my house when there are actually five of them. This was odd, but after several tries it started to see them. I had to go through typing the password through the simple buttons and simple display three times, but it finally connected and all is well.There is an app for this as well as computer software, but I chose to do everything without adding yet another app or yet another bit of software on my computer. It's likely far easier to do it with the apps etc- so unless you're just a glutton for punishment like me, just use their app.When it came time to print, this is when I became a big fan... it spits paper like crazy! I set it to print a large document, four pages per side, double sided... and wow, it was racing through it so much faster than any other printer I've had. SUPER fast at getting prints done. The print quality is fantastic, too. Double-sided printing saves SO much paper and space, too.Lexmark has always been one of my favorite printer suppliers, mostly known for their commercial machines. My last Lexmark was a color laser which was a complete disaster and never worked well at all. It ended up being recycled without ever having a successful print. Lexmark has redeemed themselves with this one- it's a business class machine that will absolutely STUN you with how fast it can put out pages. The ads say 42 pages per minute... which is faster than what I got, but plausible.Bravo, Lexmark. There are cheaper printers out there, but this one delivers performance that is worth every penny.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10V9WCIQS76AL?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B082VY58HF,2,0,No,

It took me all afternoon to get a single page printed from a pdf.I finally got google cloud print from a desktop working kind of but the machine doesn't have a lot of memory and you can hang up printing from a phone.I'm on the fence as to whether I should return it outright. I just received it today and it hasn't been even a luke warm start for a black and white ONLY printer. It wont even print right from a usb. I had a 25 page document that I tried to put on a usb and print and it would only do 6 pages max from the USB.
