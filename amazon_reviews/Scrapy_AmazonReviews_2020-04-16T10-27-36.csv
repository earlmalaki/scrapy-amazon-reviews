I needed a color laser and I spent around $400 dollars on my last color laser and it only lasted two years. At around $141 plus tax, I went ahead and took a shot on this printer. So far I have been very pleased. It prints photos as well as my old expensive printer and the text looks very nice. I guess i will see later how long the toner lasts. But at this price point, the print seems well worth it!"

The Lexmark support scan is a joke. A simple one page set-up instructions (in English) is all it would have taken. Instead what comes in the box are 3 pages of Safety information in about 30 languages (and only 4 lines of 3 pages are in English). Then the other 2 pages are also full non-English rubbish. Four months after buying and using maybe once per week or two, it prints blank pages. It gave no warning of low ink, however. I can only assume that's the problem. The Lexmark replacement cartridges on Amazon are $375.00!! I'm considering buying a different brand printer all together and starting over."

Probably a good two reams of paper and we've been satisfied with it all.It is an incredibly quick printer and scanner. The print quality is great and the ink never bleeds. I've enjoyed using this printer with my crafts, specifically my waterslide decals, because the laser ink doesn't need to be sealed and doesn't bleed under moisture. It dries quickly and applies precisely.Scanning setup took a bit more effort for me (husband wasn't home) but I got it up and running just fine by myself. The menu is color and so far has worked well, I have no problem operating this printer at all. My multiple devices have paired with it great.As far as laser printers go, and this one also being a color printer, this is an excellent choice for a home or small business printer!

What good is a printer that prints excellent pictures but constantly disconnects from your devices when you need it?! It was constantly offline.

STILL ON THE HUNT...,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JVYG5FC41HPF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"UPDATE 3.21.20I went to print on the printer for the second time since printing after set up the first day I opened this printer. I saw the same problem as I did with my previous printer. The print quality is splotchy and blurry. Part of the page didn't even print. I tried darkening the toner in the settings - same issue, no difference. I tried doing a test print - even the test print was splotchy and not clear but the very last page said no issues with cartridge. Amazon customer service said try replacing the toner (which would have cost me HUNDREDS of dollars) which was ridiculous. I am still on the hunt for just a decent printer...I am starting to question if there are any good printers out there any more.I tried another brand before this and was an awful experience printing and trying to return it. I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this. Not enough to send back because the printer is so quick and sharp, but a bit annoyed my colors on the screen won't come out on the page exactly. I hope this review helps someone."

To keep my last printer going (kind of - with murky prints) I had to replace a maintenance box twice, so the costs were adding up.At the time of writing this, it looks like there is a black toner cartridge return program that costs $85 for the black toner, making the black replacement a little less than 1/2 the cost of the printer itself - so it might just be cheaper to purchase an all-new printer when this one runs out of toner, or at least two colors."

Love the color, clarity, and ease of changing the cartridges. This is the best design... just pull open a drawer from the front, and they are laying in there in order. Lift and replace. No digging into the internals of the printer. No lifting the top of the printer. Just pull and all cartridges are available for you to replace. One of my other selection criteria was the length of the unit. My printer lives in a cabinet that is 16 inches deep and this was advertised at 15.5 inches. What isn't noted is the cord plugs into the back and goes straight back from the printer's plug. This means the effective depth is 17 inches due to the room needed to bend the cord. I have purchased a right angle plug to deal with this and that will solve my relatively small problem. The printer has a noise level when printing (and did quiet when not) however, its not much different from the Brother laser printer it replaced and is less noisy than an ink jet. For its price point and functionality - it is no problem."

I had already plugged it in, so I just hit the copy button after feeding what we needed into the right slot. That worked.So, yeah, there's more to it than that. We set up the printer on the WIFI at home. I used the interface directly on the printer. It was easy, quick and intuitive. I had no more finished when my machine beeped. It had recognized the printer and had already negotiated my machine to have access to it.The only work involved was getting the scanning software set up on my wife's machine and then getting her to act as the scan recipient (my machine had assumed that job). It was maybe, five minutes, max.The quality of the prints are good. The noise factor is low. The speed is adequate for a small family and a work-out-of-the-house business. Scans are accurate.

Typically most people don't use a laser printer at home because the replacement toner is so crazy expensive, but this isn't enough printer for a huge office either. Maybe a very small business, even a home business? It definitely yields very professional results.It took me a little while to get it set up, as I don't have a disc drive (it comes with an install disc, but for some of us that's not helpful). The enclosed instructions were not very helpful, and the on-board touchscreen wanted me to set it up for mobile using my phone, then did not provide the correct QR code or series of numbers for me to get it working. Finally I did a manual driver search using my computer's install-printer settings. Even that was a little more complex than usual because it wanted me to enter the printer's IP address manually; fortunately that number WAS on the little touchscreen, and after that it was smooth sailing.After the minor hiccups of setting it up, it worked fast and extremely well! I needed to print a full-color comic book page onto cardstock right away, and it spat it out in about 10 seconds looking absolutely perfect. I understand I'll run out of toner in about a week if I make that a habit, but it is nice to have that capability when I need it! So far it has printed very crisp, professional looking documents, and the full color prints have been absolutely flawless.It is a little larger than my inkjet (which admittedly is a big, multi-function inkjet) and it is A LOT HEAVIER. So be sure you have a good printer stand for it, because it needs it's own place. I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone and everyone for home use, as it is a whole lot of printer for just the occasional job. But if you need excellent quality printing and are able to pay for supplies, this is a very solid model."

I sometimes print photos and images on blank DVD disks, and I love that my Canon printer can do that in a very high-quality way. This Lexmark, not so much. Also, it's considerably larger than my Canon.It does spit out pages fairly quickly, about one every 3 seconds, and if you just need black and white document copies, this is a good printer for that. It's really best suited for office work.Another downside is that the toner is quite expensive. I was hoping to find a generic toner that would be compatible, but apparently none such exists yet. I know people who much prefer laser printers to inkjet, and perhaps it will last longer than my Canon inkjet printer -- I have gone through three inkjets in the last eight years -- but I still prefer the nice quality color printing of an inkjet."

I called their customer service and Jasimar helped me - (he was so patient - thank you!) and we got the thing set up so I could use it wirelessly which is awesome. However, I really need the scan function so I spent more time than I should have on Sunday trying to get the scan to email to work. Jasimar (and the instructions from the other reviewer on how to turn off the SMTP error light) disabled the ""SMTP server not set up"" error. I should have put 2 and 2 together to realize that this box needs to be unchecked if you are going to scan to email because you will have set up the SMTP so you won't have the error message! The bright side is that I got very familiar with setting up the shortcuts and the email....this printer should meet all my needs nicely now."

If you can get it to print, it prints well and quickly. If you can get it to scan, it scans well and quickly. And so on. The difficulty is getting the printer to do its jobs. The printer comes with very little in the way of instructions, and a cd that's not much help. The materials on the manufacturer's website are also mostly useless. So setting the printer up is actually quite difficult. This is not helped by the printer's lack of a real screen (it just has a small display for two lines of text). Since getting the printer, I have been using it by connecting the USB, as getting wireless printing to work every time is a chore.Without the other reviewer's comments, I would never have gotten rid of the error that reminds you to set up SMTP. Actually setting up SMTP has proved beyond my capabilities.The printer also takes a fair bit of time to start up, and it needs to be restarted quite often as its OS locks up if it's left alone.Overall, it's a good printer if you don't mind hooking up the usb every time you want to use it."

Monochrome",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LSKMKUGRULUU?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"I originally got this for my kids to use -- school projects are going to bankrupt me -- but I've been so impressed that this has become my main default printer. It will print, copy, scan and fax. Setup was simple for me -- driver update and off we go . . . and I found that it did all the things it was supposed to easily. It prints faster and cleaner images than my more expensive Brother laser. The size is convenient so it fits easily in my space (roughly 14"" square and 16"" tall). The noise while printing seems to be the same a my Brother and processing time before starting to print is a hair faster.The cons -- no auto-duplexing document feeder for scanning. I miss that more than I thought I would. It's monochrome -- somehow I missed that in the description and honestly I would have passed if I had caught that. I'm glad I didn't pass . . . but sure would be nice to have the option of color. And honestly -- that on printer menu is a pain. Two line scrolling menu to control the printer? SHEESH. Horribly cumbersome. BUT everything can be controlled from your PC using their software so no reason to ever do that again. Oh, and the smtp error. That has to be disabled or ignored.I haven't used up the starter cartridge yet but comparatively the toner price per page appears to be more expensive than the Brother. That will depend on whether I get the pages they estimate out of every cartridge or possibly more.Lastly, not specific to this printer but just a food for thought type thing -- since this is an all in one there is always the consideration that one part of the printer (say the scan function) will quit on you and you have to replace the entire unit. For me, the reduced foot print of a scanner and printer down to just printer, and a compact one at that, is worth the risk. But is is worth considering before you commit."

RJI0VX8V39ZGZ,"July 31, 2019",Summit,Vine Customer,1,C3326dw,N/A,11,1,Yes,Built like a tank & fast,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJI0VX8V39ZGZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,Thanks for taking the time to review your Lexmark C3326dw Color Laser Printer. We’re sorry to hear you are having print quality issues and want to help you fix it quickly and easily. We’ve already entered a service request on your behalf to speed things up. Just contact Lexmark Technical Support at 1-800-LEXMARK and ask the agent to reference SR 1-310 946 754 872. We look forward to hearing from you.,"I'm no stranger to laser printers- I worked my way through the I.T. industry, starting as the 'computer guy' who would come to your office to make your computers function- often elbows deep in a laser printer. Lexmark was originally a part of IBM and was separated in 1991 to be its own thing, but IBM is the go-to company for business class machines- it's even part of their name. The Lexmark printers are well known to business computing people, but probably less known to people who don't work in the computer biz and home users. Their products tend to be built to take a beating and this printer is no exception.One thing that stood out was the steel frame. It's a heavy, industrial quality machine. There isn't any ""fluff"" on it like many printers have- like touch screens and stylistic design. It's simple. The toner tray is unique and the paper tray is more simple than many- but that simplicity makes it durable. The tray latches in with a confident feel. By comparison, my HP color laser has a loose fitting, sloppy paper tray.I don't want more apps on my phone, so I configured this using the super simple little screen and buttons. The longest part was entering the password for the 2.4G network (it isn't compatible with the 5G network, boo...) but despite the simple buttons, it didn't take long as it quickly scrolls through letters and numbers. It connected instantly. I installed the whole software and driver package from the web site and noticed there is a new firmware upgrade as of a couple weeks ago- so I will apply that soon. The web site linked to the icon Lexmark places in their Windows software doesn't work. In fact, I can only bring up the printer settings when printing something- the printer control panel doesn't work any other way. One can also directly connect to the printer's web interface by simply putting the printer IP in a browser window. This is also how one updates the firmware once downloaded.Now, here's where things went a little strange. The printing I get is VERY fast and black and white prints are crisp. It defaults to printing both sides, which is annoying so I have to change settings. Color prints on mine are terrible, but since nobody else is reporting this problem I'm guessing it's because the delivery person tossed this in my driveway. I heard it hit the ground from inside the house. Packaging was minimal- the inside box has the molded foam around the printer but there was no padding between that box and the shipping box. I'll be looking into the problem more after the firmware update but the blue cartridge may be the issue. Printing various solid colors, the blue is extremely blotchy although no sign of toner leakage or damage to the cartridge. Until that is resolved, the color printing on this is extremely poor. Despite the color issue, the grainy appearance when printing a photo quality source is not nearly as good as my 6 year old HP color laser. For now, I'm only taking a star off for the wonky interface and the lousy software. Lexmark has always had wonky interfaces, but they make awesome business class printers. The printing issue on mine appears to be an anomaly and I'll update as I look to resolve it.*** update. all printing is blotchy to the point I can't even use the prints for draft working copies. I've gone through everything possible to attempt to resolve it to no avail. Not looking forward to having to deal with warranty and tech support- but I'll go through all that when I can find extra time to kill.****Second update. After trying a few basic things to try to reset the printer, it has failed to the point where it is now just a waste of space in my house. Warranty? Good luck with that. It was probably damaged when the USPS delivery involved throwing it in my driveway. Dropping off at the recycling depot today where I'll have to PAY to get rid of it."

Super easy to set up the WiFi, and to replace the toner cartridges. The paper is fast and easy to load, which I feel is important as well. So far no jams, but you really need to fan the paper before you load it. As to how long the toner lasts, I don't know, but there are ink saving settings if that is a concern of yours. Either way, I really like this printer."

I'm able to print from my two Windows-based computers and from my android phone. Document quality is superb, but photo quality is mediocre. I expected that when buying a laser, so no points off.I had several problems setting it up, most of which I think are due to a weak wifi radio. The printer is on the opposite end of the house from my router with walls, cabinets, a refrigerator between them. That said, other devices (phones, tablets, laptops, etc) work ok in this office.When turning on the printer for the first time, the screen showed a message telling me to go to a specific URL and download the Lexmark software for my mobile device to help set up the printer. I just went to the Google Play store and searched for Lexmark Mobile Assistant, and it came right up. Installed that and started the configuration. It seemed a bit complicated, but ended up working fine to configure the printer.Within the app, it suggested downloading the Lexmark printing app and the Lexmark print plugin. I did both and tried to print a picture from my phone. That's where the problems started. It would fail to connect, then connect ok long enough to send a print, then it couldn't connect anymore.I switched to setting up the Windows computers, downloaded the software from Lexmark (skipped using the CD, as they're usually out-of-date), and started the install. It couldn't locate the printer on the network, and after several tries using a couple of the options, I just clicked the Advanced button, typed in the IP address manually, and the install finished. Once that was finished, Windows could print and the printer spit out the paper with what I expected, but every time, I saw a message pop up that it couldn't connect to the printer.Eventually, after troubleshooting and searching Google, I decided to try plugging it in through an ethernet cable instead of worrying with wifi. After changing the Windows printer port to reflect the new IP address, I stopped getting the can't connect error. After deleting and re-adding the printer on my phone, it can now print as well.Overall, I'm happy with the printer, as it has the features I need for a reasonable price. As an IT person, I was able to work through the difficulties caused by the weak wifi radio, but I don't know that someone not familiar with networking would have been able to without assistance."

After spending over 10 hours on the telephone with Lexmark's 3rd party contractor/support team, the technician got the printer to print properly. The technician could not get the scanner to function with the Lexmark information supplied to the 3rd party support team.

R2QGCPEHD3BGXH,"August 15, 2019",Dora Explorer,Vine Customer,4,MC3326adwe,N/A,3,1,No,Great printer for small business or a busy household,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QGCPEHD3BGXH?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,,"I'll start by saying that we are using this printer at home.*PrintingThe printer starts up and prints very quickly, even from being fully asleep. Black and white print quality is very good. The text is very crisp and dark. Color printing is great for say printing web pages and colorful items such as that. For pictures it’s passable, but it’s not the kind of stuff you are going to print out and put into a picture frame. As long as you are printing on the front of the page only it spits the pages out very fast. If you do two sided it has to suck the page back into the printer which takes much longer. All printers that do duplex do this, so this is not specific to this printer though.We have had the printer be picky about the paper it picks up. There was one certain batch of paper (and we do not remember where it came from, sorry) that it had trouble picking up and jammed once and printed crooked on the rest. Everything else we have fed it has been fine.*ScanningThe scanning seems to be pretty good. The automatic document feeder is a very nice feature, and is something we considered essential – I’m too old to stand there and swap pages manually.Another nice thing about the scanner is that it functions on its own. Some lesser printers require software on a computer and the devices have to be connected and all that in order to scan things. This is a pain and never works well for me. With the Lexmark printer though, you can email the scan jobs and as long as you have the email server set up it requires no computer or additional setup.It’s not immediately obvious, but if you set up what the printer calls a shortcut, that’s basically the address book for the scanner. Also, this is 10x easier to set up if you go to the web page of the printer. It can be done from the front panel but typing on the keyboard is a little painful. Just go to the IP of the printer in your web browser and you can set that up much easier.*Software and DriversThere is also an app that helps you set up wireless and such for the printer. It wasn’t great but it got the job done, just follow the instructions.We have android phones and used the android print plugin. It has low ratings in the play store, but for us it worked well without any issues at all.The latest version of windows 10 found the printer but did not have a driver to print with. If you go to the Lexmark website and type in the printer name, there’s a small download that will install drivers and find the printer and everything seems to work OK.For a mac, I was a little concerned when there wasn’t any mac version of the printer driver to download at first. When I tried to add it anyway I realized that the printer speaks airprint/bonjour and the printer was immediately found and added with no drama whatsoever.*Aesthetics/Fit and finishThe printer is a decent sized one, it’s bigger than most consumer printers, but it’s not huge. It feels well built and does not feel cheap or flimsy.The screen is touch and works very well, with intuitive menus and plenty of options. When you are using the keyboard things get a little tedious, but it does work and works well enough to actually use.The paper tray holds a fair amount of paper, and a nice feature is the printer knows how much paper is in the tray and when you look at “supplies” under the printer driver or in the web page, it will give you a useful indicator of the amount of paper."

This printer is about the same size as my old inkjet, but it is a bit heavier. I think the extra weight must equate to extra quality, because this printer is superior to every printer that I have ever owned. The setup instructions were a numbered set of pictures to follow. Once it was unboxed and plugged in, I simply turned it on and followed the on screen instructions. After connecting to my network, I could print from my iPhone or computer, and I didn’t have to download or install drivers. Everything it does is effortless and fast, and I love that there are no lights showing when it’s in “sleep mode.”"
R21NOJFP9M5O7L,"August 2, 2019",Shane O. Laake,Vine Customer,5,MC3326adwe,N/A,4,0,No,Rather compact and very capable for the price,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21NOJFP9M5O7L?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,,"The box that the unit shipped in was rather large, though when you remove the foam padding and consider that this is a color laser all in one with duplexing and a sheet feeder, it's rather compact. Setup starts with removing from the aforementioned foam, removing a large bag, and removing a bunch of tear away strips. Note there are pull tabs on all of the toner cartridges as well.Software setup can be completed via an app on your phone, but not if you're rocking the ethernet (which I prefer). Web download of the latest drive is a bit of a pain, as Lexmark uses the whole separate support page vs sales page strategy. The latter comes up first in any searches, but clicking support dumps you at the main support page. Boo! Once you find the software/drivers, it's also a bit of a miss, as I needed to specify my OS and 32/64 bitness, which is very 2009, and not 2019.That aside, the software installed easily, and it defaulted to not sending info back to lexmark--kudos! This thing prints crazy fast--go back to the last sentence and read this thing prints, and that's how long it took to do a full color portrait. Granted this isn't a photo printer, but it'll meet every need short of that expectation. My last home color laser was an OG four pass model, so this is such a revelation! The quality of print is also equal to the task.I don't do a lot of scanning, but it does a solid job, and the feeder is greatly appreciated (the limited scanning I do tends to be multipages documents I've signed). I haven't (and won't) use the fax. Copies are quite snappy!All in all, I love this printer. So much nicer than any inkjet! Toner doesn't bleed, and it's so fast. I haven't used this one enough to speak to reliability, but for now, assume it's spot on (I'll update if/when it isn't).Highly recommended"
RTK9V316GMLB3,"July 31, 2019",Scott McElhiney,Vine Customer,4,MC3326adwe,N/A,5,0,No,"Good quality, check out cost of replacement toner",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTK9V316GMLB3?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T5PRRXD,,"This was super easy to setup, I followed the pictures in the instructions for removing all the tape strips etc... plugged it in and used the USB to my desktop. Didn't need that though as it also setup the wifi to my network via the keyboard (could have used a mobile app on my phone), with me just pushing the button on my cable router and it found it and made a secure connection in seconds. Probably the second thing I've ever had connect where I didn't have to go through punching in a long password with correct capital letters and is that a 1 or a i or an L? I printed a test page and it did it fast and very high quality. Then I took one of my photographic pieces of artwork and laid it in the scanner bed and copied it. The only dramatic difference I see between the professional print and the copy is due to using paper that is more like parchment so I have texture rather than a glossy print. I don't believe anyone would purchase this for printing artwork, but in a pinch it'll due without leaving a horribly colored print with lines.It's size is what one would expect from a modern all in one... this is substantial, but not an office printer for those collating hundreds of copies of large documents at a time. Only one drawer for paper, so changing paper type will involve removing and reloading with whatever you need.It does two sided duplex printing automatically, so you don't have to reload paper, that is a nice feature. And you can send stuff to this pretty much any way imaginable, wi-fi, usb, ethernet, including through a few apps from your Apple or Android products.It also still includes FAX capability, something I haven't tried out because I haven't had a landline in years. It can email scans to your devices which I suspect will get used a lot more than the FAX machine part, but if you are in a business that still sends or recieves faxes, just plug in and it asks for the business name and phone number to configure itself. If you run a small office, that has a land line, I know that people pay for that when they NEED to send something by fax, so a potential profit center.The only downside I see to this is the cost of supplies. If you buy the cartridges for 2500 color copies from Lexmark with their return program supplies, it's $99.99 per color cartridge and there are three of those. 3000 pages for the black cartridge and it's $96.99. Their website shows them all on backorder, so hopefully as this printer penetrates the market, the price of supplies drops and availability increases.Given the choice between brands, the only one in the modern market I do not like is the one that times out it's supplies and lacks good support... and that isn't this. I've had good luck with Lexmark products in the past and this looks like a contender, just compare cost of supplies before jumping in."

Freezes and won't respond to anything without power cycling. Paper jam error messages constantly - ""COMPLETELY REMOVE PAPER TRAY, CLEAR THE JAM..."" --- there is no paper jam. This happens following a power-up and nearly every time I use the paper bypass. I'm regretting the purchase. Otherwise, print quality is good and it's very fast. I do like the smallish footprint, but no doc feeder, no fax and too many interruptions to reset and clear imaginary jams...Original review:First off, I'm an engineer at an automation company and totally speak the language. Nonetheless, I nearly sent this printer back after starting to read faq and hunting through the HORRIBLE Lexmark site. I just didn't want to deal with a bunch of stress simply to setup a desktop printer. That said, it took me all of 5-minutes (Windows 10) to get things up and running: remove tape and tabs that are clearly indicated, load paper, power up and follow instructions on the touchscreen. I did not install the included CD software; I did not do any firmware update - it's working fine, so unless I find something, it'll likely stay this way. Every computer in our office group connected easily (Add Printer, found the Lex immediately, select ...done).This model (MC3224dwe) does NOT have fax; I assumed this was an ""all-in-one"" device which is how I started my search criteria: ""all in one color laser printer"". My fault for not reading specs carefully - Amazon search fails like this often and I know better. I purchased because of good reviews and price - so far, so good."

I finally decided to go with this one because it seems all printers get bad reviews but this one didn't seem to be too bad. I received my first one very quickly and I was very excited. I opened it and saw that the scanning bed was cracked. So, back in the box it went. Mind you, this is a heavy machine and it's not easy to pack it up, etc. I requested a new one to be sent to me.The second machine took longer to get to me but I got it in about 3 days. I got it out of the box and got it set up. I connected it to my internet and thought things would be realitively each. No such luck. You have to down load an app to your phone to be able to print from your phone. I do a LOT of printing from my phone or Ipad. So, I down load the app and it can't find the printer even though they are on the same network. After getting the manual off of HP website and doing some searching, I realize it's because one of the settings is wrong. Sorry - I can't remember the setting now and I don't have the printer any longer. So, I set the indicator and it seems my phone sees the printer. Yea! So, I go to send a document to the printer. It's about a 10 page document. My current deskjet would hardly take any time to print this type of document. I waited and waited, etc.... The printer kept saying it was receiving the document but wasn't printing. After about 30 minutes, I decided to try to set up the software on my printer. Of course, in the middle of setting up the software, the printer decided to 'start' printing my document but only printed about a quarter of one page and that is all I ever saw it print.So, I decided to try to concentrate on getting my computer set up. Again, my deskjet was never an issue. Find the printer and start printing. I updated the software and tried to print a document again from my computer. I kept getting communication errors between my computer and the printer. The printer was online the whole time and so was my computer. Mind you this went on for a few hours one night and into the next day.When I finally think something is printing, it printed a small box and then I got a firmware error. So, I went to look for an update. Again, you have to connect thru your computer to the printer using the computer number. The printer was showing me the number but everytime I tried to access it, it would time out. I tried this for a few hours. This is the only way I could find in the manual to actually update the firmware on the printer, but since I could not get to the actual menu, I couldn't update it.By this time, I'm fed up. So, I decided in the end to just return the second machine also. Please keep in mind, that I work in IT. I'm not a hardware person, but I can figure out most things if I have instructions. I don't know how they expect anyone to get this working without support. Yes, I could have called for help and it might have been resolved, but I don't like to have to call for help. It should have been working or easily fixed when I connected."

I use it regularly everyday with complete satisfaction.Packaging is quite good with a foam shell encasing the printer, all movable components are thoroughly secured with tape and the entire bundle covered in a plastic bag. The included instruction booklet is a little minimalist and it does not come with a printer cable. Most annoying is actually the included software CD, I haven't used discs in over a decade and all my rigs are custom built so the disc is useless and the online support site is not friendly for support. The adwe version of the MB2236 is not actively supported at this time and checking the other versions only provided a driver for 1 of them, no software at all. I noticed the CD said G4 lexmark software and a quick search found me a downloadable version that works perfectly but for some reason it's not on the MB2236 support pages.Setup is a little rough depending on your networking capabilities. I hoped for a more user friendly setup. I've been building my own computers for 20 years and while networking is not my strong point I'm not a complete novice. The flexibility with this unit means there's tons of options to deal with and the unit didn't come plug n' play, it had to have the network setup to connect wirelessly and I found the G4 software was necessary for regular, continuous use. Just the driver installed allowed me to print initially but afterwards, say after restarting, the printer wouldn't auto connect or even register as online/available. With the G4 software I can print whenever without issue.Print quality is excellent, the printer is quite capable and does 2 sided printing with ease even from the copy function. Copy quality is good and overall speed is pretty good. I set the unit to wake, print, go back to sleep and it does so flawlessly. I have noticed the noise it makes while printing is a little clunky, while the printer performs admirably and professionally, that noise makes it sound a bit on the cheap and flimsy side though nothing else about it instills those feelings.Lastly, the ink cartridges are on the expensive side. I have bought many toner cartridges for most of the major brands and this one is about twice the cost of the equivalent version of the brand I use at work. Overall, once you get past the setup hurdles it's a great printer that does a lot of stuff and does them well. I am a long time fan of Lexmark, having never had problems with them and appreciating the quality. I am not disappointed with this unit at all, I wish the ink was more in-line cost wise with other brands but it's a solid product that I'm glad I ordered."

R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ,"July 29, 2019",Just Plain Larry,Vine Customer,3,MB2236adwe,N/A,134,1,No,3 stars and I'll explain in the review WHY only 3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YDAUDGAJX3FZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,,"===Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with the manufacturer and always write from my true experience. But please note that I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review.===Review begins:Just a heads up since some people may miss this. Monochrome= black and white printing ONLY. This is NOT a color laser printerThis has the POTENTIAL to be a great printer but there are several things that caused me to deduct pointsPROS:1. Good print speed. I did a 50 page double sided document in less than 2 minutes.2. 3 ways to connect. Wireless, Ethernet or USB3. Good scanning speed. I scanned a 20 page document in 40 seconds. And it WILL scan to a color document, it just won't PRINT in color.4. Compact and lightweight. At 16.5"" W x 13"" D x 14"" high it will fit almost anywhere. And at 16 pounds weight, it is a breeze to carry around. If you are old school like me, and you remember the early lasers that required 2 men, a horse and a hoist to put in place, you will appreciate the lightweight of this product5. Automatic Duplex Printing. You don't have to wait for it to print the odd numbered pages, and then reload the first prints for the even numbered pages. It automatically pulls the sheet back and prints the second side6. 250 page paper tray. Not nearly as much paper loading. And it handles letter and LEGAL size easily.6. At 5% toner lay down, you get crisp clear sharp text.7. Starter cartridge included.8. Built-n Web Server so you can check on status, jobs, level of supplies etc.9. It's multi-function so you can fax, scan, copy or print.10. When it's done for the day, it takes you out to dinner. OK not really, but it does a lot of things.So with all that, why only 3 stars you ask?1. The setup guide is a pictograph, not text.2. There is no manual included in the box or on the CD. I can understand not including a 187 page manual on paper, but they could have at least included the manual in PDF format on the CD. I had to go to support.lexmark.com to get the manual.3. It has a separate imaging unit from the toner cartridge. The unit is rated for 12,000 pages. We don't usually print that much in a year, but what about folks who print 3,000 pages a month? Every 4 months you will have to replace the imaging unit.4. And now, My BIGGEST gripe about this product. TONER COST!!!!!!!! Unless you are willing to participate in their Return program, which means you buy the cartridge and only use it once you can expect to pay $275-$350 for an extra high yield cartridge (6,000 pages) and from $90-$150 for a regular cartridge (1,200 pages) . And even on the return program for a regular yield (1,200 pages) they start at $48 depending on where you shop for it.Between having to replace toner, and having an external imaging unit, I don't care that it takes you out for dinner (again, just kidding). The operating costs for this product are too high for every day usage except in a small office. I was hoping to retire my old HP 1020, but that isn't going to happen until the consumable costs come way down. This printer is a fairly new release, so it is hard to find remanufactured consumables yet.So if you can overlook the consumables cost, then this is a good printer for daily use, even if it is not economical to use. The output is clear and sharp. Scanner works great. I did not test the fax since our fax server is in another room from the printer. Fast printing. Fast scanning. Wi-Fi enabled. Mid-point price range. Ethernet ready. USB Front port for printing from a flash drive. Network capable. USB Ready as well. Color control panel that's large enough to work with. Compact design and weight.But I am still only giving it 3 stars for the consumables cost.End of Review===Thank you for taking a minute out of your busy life to read my review.

RKE300SDONE1E,"July 25, 2019",Cynthia Daniel,Vine Customer,4,MB2236adwe,N/A,0,0,No,Multifunction Wireless MONOCROME Laser Printer with a 2.9” LED Color Touch Screen,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKE300SDONE1E?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,,"Well I’ll tell what I didn’t like first because it’s my fault not the printers. I didn’t think about what Monochrome meant I just saw Color Touch Screen and thought it was a color printer. Its not, but it is a very sharp black ink printer. So now here is everything else that is wonderful about this machine.It’s small enough to fit comfortably on a desk. It prints on both sides, scans, faxes, copies, and sends. The tray capacity is up to 250 pages plus it has a single sheet feeder. It’s wireless so that you can call it from your mobile devices like your tablet or smart phone. USB or Ethernet connectivity is also available. It’s also secure and keeps your information safe.Another feature is faxing and when your faxing is done it prints out a log with your cover page showing the status of your fax along with the time, date, how many pages, and the number where it was sent.The printer itself is quite clear. I just wish I had paid more attention and it had been a color printer."

If you've never had a printer before, you'll be surprised how easily this sets up and the speed of performance."
RNHYK0Q4REJCR,"July 21, 2019",Angela Tyler,Vine Customer,4,MB2236adwe,N/A,0,0,No,I didn't know what monochrome meant,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNHYK0Q4REJCR?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3HB1VZ,,"It only prints in black and white, it said in the description ""monochrome ' but I didn't know what that meant, and I focused on the description of the ""LED touchscreen monitor in color"" to make me think this printer printed on color as well as black and white. Although only in B&W, it prints wonderfully. It did take a bit to get it set up, it's a great asset to have for printing papers, just not pictures (my reason for getting this printer)."
RYUB0RC2X96PZ,"July 14, 2019",MazeteMazete,Verified Purchase,4,MB2236adw,N/A,3,0,No,"Inconvenient and bad first impression, but inexpensive and funtional.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYUB0RC2X96PZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"PROS: There is a lot of value in this printer. I got it for $133. Very nice that it scans, copies, faxes, and can print on both sides of paper. It comes with starter toner. It's not very noisy and it prints fast. Also it shipped fast even though I only get the standard free shipping.CONS: The only way to scan is to run a program on your computer. You have to start the program, select the device, meddle with settings, click scan, maybe have to select the right hostname, THEN push the shortcuts button on the printer, select Scan to computer, select the profile, wait for the scanner to scan the item, then tell it you don't want to scan another page, then it save to your computer. There is a ""Start Immediately"" option in the program which gets rid of all the button-pushing on the printer except for telling it not to scan another page. There's no option in the menu on the printer to scan to file, which makes no sense. I've used all-in-one printers before where you just put what you want to scan on the flatbed, push the scan button, and it saves a file on your computer. Also, the scanning flatbed doesn't scan near the very edge, so make sure you leave at least 1/4"" in order to scan the whole item. I suppose if you scan a piece of paper it wouldn't be an issue because of the margins, but I use it to scan cards and checks, so you have to leave space near the edge of the flatbed.It is needlessly complicated to get this printer working in Linux. The driver page says this model is supported (shorturl.at/vyX25), but the OS compatibility page says it's not supported (shorturl.at/oCFJ9). It took me hours to finally get it working. You have to download a special driver for CUPS (shorturl.at/iqz06). There's no reason that the CUPS driver couldn't have been included with the printer driver. Also, the included driver disc doesn't include anything for Linux, only Windows.The duplex printing isn't aligned right because it doesn't print both sides at the same time. It prints page one, pulls the paper back inside, then prints page two. Doing this makes the paper a little bit crooked. It's not extreme, but it's definitely noticeable. Make sure you have plenty of margins on what you're duplex printing or it will get cut off.The screen will always flash a red light and display an SMTP error. The only way to stop the error and light is to either setup SMTP or disable it. There is no way to disable it in the menu on the printer. You have to access the printer settings in your web browser and disable it there.All in all, I'm satisfied with this printer. It was a great price and it's all-in-one. However, it was a huge hassle to setup and the way to scan is stupid. I recommend this printer if you're on a budget and need a lot of functionality, but can handle inconvenience."
R3DRARC2UN4FLX,"July 13, 2019",Sagewood,Vine Customer,4,MB2236adw,N/A,0,0,No,"Great printer, but prints only in black and white",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DRARC2UN4FLX?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"This printer is really awesome and easy to set-up in few minutes with very little help and guide from the instruction manual. Though I think the set- up was relatively easy for me because I have a lot of experience with printers and electronic gadgets and may not be so easy for a newbie to set-up.I ordered this Laser printer because my old one does not as efficiently I would like (very slow). This Lexmark printer prints very fast; so when you are printing papers in a hurry it doesn't waste your time and does the job quickly. Another great feature is that it supports printing from my mobile devices with our wireless Wi-Fi network. I was able to print from my devices and connects seamlessly. My favorite part about this printer is the 2 - sided printing because it saves a lot of paper. It was able to hold about 150 sheets of paper which is a good upgrade from my previous printer which could barely squeeze 100 printing paper. The only thing I don’t like about this printer is the fact that it only prints in black ink. For me this is fine but my kids need some of their school projects to be printed in color. Which is a bit of a deal breaker, especially when this printer has faxing but no color. Faxing is something I will almost never use, while colored printing is important to my kids. Overall this is a great printer for the price point, but I wish it had option for color printing."
R369M0HXD51CGA,"July 12, 2019",CorpGovNet,Vine Customer,4,MB2236adw,N/A,1,0,No,"OEM Refills Only, Since New Model: Setup Difficult",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R369M0HXD51CGA?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"This is a great quality printer. Prints quickly with high quality imaging. Document feeder works fine. I found it easy to connect via wi-fi to my computers. I really like having a document feeder and a flatbed scanner, which is really handy when scanning books.However, there are a couple of problems. First, there's the blinking red light indicating server error. Luckily for you, a May 16, 2019 by reviewer going by the name 'Amazon Customer,' spent hours fixing the problem and tells you in their review how to do it more quickly.Second, getting the scanner to scan to e-mail is also a pain that took another reviewer hours to sort out. Read the July 10, 2019 review by 'Bella' and you'll also get that done much more quickly.Those issues are real (so one star off) but once fixed you should love the printer with one other exception. Since it is new, no one is making less expensive toner cartridges for it and Lexmark isn't the most popular brand, so it may take a while until they do. I'm taking another 1/2 star off for that (I am rounding down to three stars.)Still, OEM toner cartridges are only $50 and they should print about 1,200 pages. That works out to slightly over 4 cents a page. Or you can get a high yield cartridge for $78 that prints 3,000 pages (2.6 cents a page) That's more than I pay (except on my color printer) but much less expensive than most inkjets.Laser printers really are the way to go. Once you get the setup issues resolved, I expect you'll like the printer. By the time you get through the 700 starter cartridge, maybe someone will make a less expensive compatible cartridge. Or, you could check out Brother printers. They seem to be the most popular. I pay around 1/2 a cent for the ink for each page on my black and white Brother... although sometimes it isn't as nice and crispy as it should be."
R267GU2ETRU9V7,"July 10, 2019",Bella,Vine Customer,3,MB2236adw,N/A,4,0,No,Solid printer with one major downfall,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R267GU2ETRU9V7?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"I was surprised how easy this printer was to set up (minus the SMTP scan to email part), despite the instructions only having pictures. There's only one cord to plug in. Once you've finished the instructions load up the software disc in your computer (alternatively if you don't have a disc drive, download the software off of lenmarks website for this specific model) at that point the printer directs you to download an app called ""Lenmark Mobile assistant"" and connect to the wifi with the printers model as a name on your phone. Once you've done that, go back to your computer and you'll see the set up now detects the printer and downloads the appropriate software for that specific model. Theres also some optional software you can install that adds features such as saved fax contacts, the ability to fax multiple people at once, etc. It comes with toner so it's ready to print out of box. Note: it's normal that the two USB-A ports are blocked off by a little plastic piece, this printer does not come with USB-A functionality, only USB-B functionality (USB-B port is located in the back, see attached pic).I didn't experience SMTP error the other reviewer noted, I did however, notice the slight flickering of the power button but it doesn't bother me. You don't need to use the Lenmark app to print if you don't mind turning on the printer before printing (you do however need it to scan documents to save as digital files if you want to avoid setting up the SMTP server), you can use Google cloud print/Samsung cloud print, Apple airprint, etc.You have to be connected to the same wifi that the printer is connected to in order to print from your phone, tablet, laptop, etc., which means you cannot print while away from home. Lexmark has a paid subscription service (Lexmark Cloud Print Management) that allows you to print while connected to any wifi but I believe it's only available for businesses. My biggest pet peeve with this printer is you have to manually turn it on each time unless you use lenmarks dedicated app, which kinda eliminates the majority of the convenience of cloud print since you have to walk over to the printer like a 2002 shmuck, and I'm not a super big fan of having an app on my phone/tablet just to use my printer when cloud print and air print already exist ya know?SCANNING DOCUMENTS:From what I understand, you have two options for scanning documents. Either set up the SMTP server for scan to email functionality (which you'll either have to do yourself or call Lexmark and they'll do it for you via remote access to your computer) or you'll have to use the ""Lexmark mobile print"" app. If you decide to call Lexmark technical support to have them set it up for you DO NOT call near closing time (9pm EST) because they WILL hang up on you in the middle of working on your computer. I called at 8:37pm EST (I didn't think it would take very long) to have them help me set it up and they hung up on me with no warning after one hour of being on the phone with them, so I basically wasted an hour of my day. Finally, after the third call (each lasting about an hour each) we finally got the scan to email function working. The problem is, the only way to do it is to turn on access for less secure apps in your Google account settings (see screenshot) which puts the security of your Google account at risk. I suggest either using a throwaway email to scan things or not using the scan to email function at all.CONS:- Black and white printing only- A bit bulky- Aesthetically lacking- You have to manually turn on the printer to cloud print (unless you use lenmarks app)- You have to be connected to the same wifi the printer is to cloud print- No USB type A ports (therefore you can't use USB flash drives without an adapter)- Somewhat stingy starter cartridge (prints 700 pages)- Toner for this printer isn't the cheapest- You have to manually turn over double sided pages when scanning- SMTP scan to email function set up is unnecessarily complicated w/ no directionsPROS:- Easy set up- Save money on ink- Wireless printing is convenient- More security features than other printers at this price pointCONCLUSION:If you're tired of buying overpriced ink, get a laser printer. They're more of an investment, but generally tend to have a longer lifespan than ink jet printers. This is a solid printer but it's biggest downfall is the SMTP scan to email function. It's an absolute headache and I recommend avoiding it altogether. Luckily, there is a workaround that doesn't sacrifice being able to scan physical documents and turn them into digital ones, but you have to use lenmarks app. If you're fine with that, don't rule out this printer as an option."
RO5E9LDMF155E,"July 4, 2019",@TrevorHikes,Vine Customer,4,MB2236adw,N/A,2,0,No,"Painful Setup, Great Printing",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO5E9LDMF155E?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,I've set up a lot of printers over the years and overall wireless printer setup can be tough but this printer's wireless setup process is horrible and in my case - impossible. The app they have you download could never find the printer. Luckily I had a CAT-5 cable already set up so I chose that method and was up and running quickly. I also had trouble loading the paper the first time. Luckily my wife figured it out. So the best advice I have is to make sure there is someone smart nearby. Print quality and speed are fantastic.
R1EYFMTU3OCMLZ,"June 29, 2019",dan rossi,Vine Customer,4,MB2236adw,N/A,1,0,No,Setup is a bear.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EYFMTU3OCMLZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,,"When i got this in i immediately unboxed and tryed to set it up. When i turned it on the screen it asked with or without disc, now i have nothing in my house that takes a disc so i went for using the app. Well the app is useless, the screen gives u a id to type in which doesn't exist in the app so i decided to use the scan the back of the unit option. It scanned, told me it didnt see it. I had to download a different app other then the one that it told me to use.So there is the print app and a mobile assistance app that sees your wifi network. It seemed to work untill i hit print and only heard the rollers spin, then nothing. In order for me to get it to work i had to plug in my either net cable. Also if it wasnt for another reviewer i would have never figured how to get rid of the red blinking light.Now that it's hardwired and my phone and laptop see it the unit works great. It prints fast and scans fast. I just need to plug my phone jack in to try the fax out.Just beware if this is in your house u will most likely have some issues getting it up and running."
RGZ49J58DX0W5,"May 16, 2019",Amazon Customer,Verified Purchase,3,MB2236adw,N/A,64,6,Yes,"Great little printer, aside from a few inconvenient oversights",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGZ49J58DX0W5?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N27LPPG,"Hello - We wanted to respond and thank you for your recent comments on the Lexmark MB2236adw. This feedback was very valuable and we wanted to let you know what steps we have taken to correct these issues.We have addressed the flickering light situation that you mentioned and have a new firmware release available on Lexmark.com that addresses it. You can go here to download it: support.lexmark.com/firmwareAlso, based on your feedback, we have taken action to improve the SMTP set-up situation as well. A new firmware release is in process and will be available soon. In the interim, we are going to have new devices default to the setting being OFF vs. ON as products leave the factory. We believe that most users will not need to set up SMTP on their devices, but if someone does, they can turn that setting on from the menu or via our web tool.Again, thank you for your insight. We value it and appreciate it and welcome your comments or questions.Best Regards,Lexmark"," I expected this printed to work out of the box, but there is one issue that breaks this whole experience. When you connect via WiFi and finish all the setup you are presented with the error “SMTP server not set up. Contact system administrator” and a constant flashing red light on the right side of the printer panel. I did all the connection steps correctly and had to spend some hours trying to research the problem online. After finding no solution in the manuals or online I decided to email Lexmark. It turns out you need to connect to the printer via your web browser to turn off a specific setting so this error goes away. This was quite irritating for me as I wasted almost half a day trying to figure out the problem. The printer works fine without addressing this error but there will be the constant red light flashing and the error on the screen which can be annoying. I think the Lexmark software guys should have had that printer setting activated by default out of the box so customers wouldn’t have to go through these extra steps.The last negative I have found is the power button light. On my unit there is a subtle flicker which you can notice from afar. This is also a little annoying at least for me. I have attached a video of the problem. I’m not sure if all units are like this or just mine.Now to the good things. This printer looks great. I love the aesthetic and someone gave me a compliment for it when they saw it sitting next to my desk. It looks modern and I prefer the white and light tones over dark plastic printers that sometimes look very ugly up in person. The printer is very compact for being a multi-function printer. The print quality is great from what I saw on sheet. When you put paper inside the tray it does extend about an inch from the back of the printer to accommodate the standard letter size so bear that in mind.If Lexmark did not program the printers to show the SMTP error by default and if the power light did not flicker I would have given it a higher score.TIP: to fix the SMTP error you need to press the wrench button on the printer panel > Reports > OK > Network > OK > Network Setup Page > OK. This will print out the printer’s IP address which you will need.On the page that prints out, the IP address will be on the top. Now go to your web browser on your computer that is on the same network as the printer and type that IP address in the address bar and hit enter. The printer’s Embedded Web Server or software should show up. Click on E-mail under Settings and check the box that says ‘Disable “SMTP server not set up” error’. Click the save button. You are set. That pesky error will go away and the dreadful red flashing light too."
RBTHRAZ152JT9,"September 10, 2019",Matthew R,Vine Customer,5,B2236dw,N/A,2,0,No,"Fast black and white.  No ink drying issues like inkjet.  Wireless, USB or Ethernet",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBTHRAZ152JT9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,,"I do like this printer but my out of box experience was not great. I unboxed it and removed the tape from the various locations that are supposed to keep things in place during shipping. I answered a few questions on the little screen like what language do I speak and timezone, etc. Then I adjusted the paper tray to fit Letter size paper. With letter paper, the drawer hangs out of the back of the printer a little. I said to keep the paper size as letter and it said to clear a jam in the back of the printer.Well, I assumed it had to do with the paper tray since that stuck out. It was actually a piece in the door on the back of the printer that was causing the issue. Once I opened that drawer and put the piece in properly, everything went well.I got the driver from the Lexmark website. I plugged it in via ethernet and the IP address conveniently displayed on the screen. I was able to print right away.I have to say that these little printers are pretty impressive these days. I worked on laser printers and even repaired them way back in the HP 4 days. Those printers could not duplex and didn't print anywhere near as fast as these modern laser printers.I think this is a nice desk printer for someone in an office or home office. It is a great little home printer. The biggest thing for me is that it is laser and not inkjet. I have tried to use color inkjets for years. They print nice quality and the color is great. The downside is that I don't print color all that often and when I do print it is almost always black and white. (or black and white would be acceptable at least for my purposes) The ink would always dry up between uses on my inkjet printers and the ink costs more than the printer. (like razors and razor blades)It turns out that toner for this laser is quite expensive and depending on how you order it, it can be close to the price of the printer. (though the price here is very good at the moment at around $100) There are 3 different capacity toners. If you use the Lexmark return program, you save a lot of money. (you give them the empty cartridge back and you save a ton)I'm sure there will be 3rd party toner options at some point but this is what I found on the Lexmark site as far as pricing for the return program toner:Lexmark B221000 Black Return Program Toner CartridgeB221000 1200 $44.99Lexmark B221H00 Black High Yield Return Program Toner CartridgeB221H00 3,000 $79.99Lexmark B221X00 Black Extra High Yield Return Program Toner CartridgeB221X00 6,000 $159.99I only listed the price of the return program toners because the other ones are really expensive and it wouldn't make sense to buy them. (just return it and save a lot) I assume that 3rd party toners will be available at some point and may not require you to return them for a reasonable price.I have no complaints about the printer. It is somewhat compact, quiet and fast. It even prints duplex (2-sided) if you want. I love that it is WiFi capable. I had several old HP printers laying around my house that had good toner in them until fairly recently. I was basically able to print for free. They smelled bad, took up too much space and took forever to warm up.These modern, compact, desktop printers are pretty impressive. I think if you compare the cost of toner for this printer with an inkjet printer, the laser is a little less expensive on paper. In the real world, however, if you have to change your ink cartridges in your inkjet because they dried out, the laser is way less expensive.I do keep a color inkjet around for printing photos. I do not look forward to using it and going through the cleaning cycles and possibly buying ink cartridges when it has sat too long. For most of my printing, this little guy will do what I want."
R3E4SR1S3M306F,"August 6, 2019",D. Michael Elkins,Vine Customer,4,B2236dw,N/A,0,0,No,"Mac users, please set up using a printer cable!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3E4SR1S3M306F?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,," I spent at least a half hour trying to figure out how to set up this printer to use with my Mac computer and laptop today. Visit the Lexmark website and you'll see a message that makes it appear that there isn't a driver available but then there's also something to download that will download but won't readily open with any application. I then just tried to add the printer using the ""add printer"" command in the system preferences but the computers could not find the printer. I was then about ready to give up when I noticed an option of connecting the printer by using a printer cable, which of course, is never supplied with any printer that you buy. I salvaged one from an old printer, attached it to my computer and the printer and the printer showed up immediately as one of my ""add printer"" options. Once I had added the printer, I was able to disconnect the cable and it printed flawlessly thereafter through my office's wireless network.Something that I found strange was when I tried to load up standard 8x11 copy paper. Although you wouldn't expect it, to load what I consider the standard size paper, you must extend the back of the tray from its normal configuration, which causes the back of the tray to extend out from the back of the printer, as seen in the attached picture. Why?Once I was able to get the printer up and running, I had no problems with it operating smoothly and quickly as can be seen in my video.I am using this printer as a replacement for my workhorse Brother HL-L2370DW, which still works fine but for the annoying warning about me needing to replace parts, even after they have already been replaced. Yes, I have searched online for the fix but the suggested one didn't work. You would think that if a unit is smart enough to know when it is time to replace a part, it should be smart enough to know when that part has been replaced without the owner having to go online to determine how to reset the warning indicator."
R20RGYCO94IM01,"August 5, 2019",Shadez82,Vine Customer,4,B2236dw,N/A,0,0,No,"Really nice laser printer, but lacks instruction",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20RGYCO94IM01?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,,This laser printer is great! First thing I noticed right out of the box is that it is SUPER light. I had no issues removing it from the box and carrying it over. There is a grip on the bottom of the printer so you do not have to worry about it sliding. The printer does lack instructions I feel for setting up. I looked through all the box but there are only warning and a physical setup for the device. One thing about the physical device setup is that you need to make sure to remove all the table and the covers for the toner cartridge. I would recommend that when removing the covers for the toner to do it possibly outside. The reason being is that there is a plastic tab you need to pull and remove. I honestly though I would break it pulling this plastic strip out but it does take a good amount of pull to remove. Do not worry this is something you NEED to remove to bring printing. It will carry about a small amount of toner if you are pulling on it so doing it outside will ensure you do not get toner all over your desk or carpet. Also when remove the paper cover just cut or rip it slowly and remove it. There is a part on the toner you do not want to touch. There is a drive disk if you need it but if you do not have it a simple google of the model will take you to the download page. The paper tray will have not have the paper completely pushed down and that's okay. It will be elevated in the tray. The screen just traditional black and white. There is no color or visual and the controls are fairly easy to navigate once you get use to it. The setup was a bit annoying as it loops for some reason through a lot of the setup. The printer does use a traditional computer plug to power the device and uses a type b usb cable. Be aware that the device does not come with that cable so if you want to do a direct connection you will need to purchase that separately. You can manually set up the wifi on the device itself just be aware you will have to rotate through all of the different characters. I have not had any connection issues and once on the internet network you can easily search for the printer on the network and connect to it. The printer prints super fast. It can shoot out the printout in I would say 1-2 seconds after it is done warming up. You do not have to wait very long to get the print out. It has all the indicator lights to show low on toner or low on paper. It is not a very big printer so you do not have to worry about it taking up too much space. Overall this print is a nice printer to have if you only print in black and white as well as want something that will last you a long time before replacing the toner. It also great to have for a small office as well. The only issue I have is the instructions apart from the physical setup is lacking.

I have this in my office and it makes printing much more straightforward. it can print a stack of 40 pages before you can even blink. in black and white, of course. Although, I wouldn't use this for anything other than text documents. However, the cartridge that is combined barely lasted me 150 prints before it required to be replaced...

This is a good printer if you simply want an inexpensive printer that prints black and white well. The print quality is good and the wireless capabilities work well. If I could review it based on that alone, it would be a 5 star inexpensive printer. It does have duplex (double sided printing) though it did take me some time to figure this out. Once I figured it out, it is a nice feature.But, and this is a big one, the set up for a non tech savvy person depends all on interpreting the photo on the enclosed insert. There are no written instructions. I was able to figure out how to set this up to my wireless network just by plugging it in and following the prompts on the printer screen. I didn't think it was difficult but it definitely takes someone who would think of it instead of relying on directions. There are plugs to connect it directly to a computer but I wanted this for the wireless capability.The size of the printer is a little big for the lack of other functions and I wish the cord were just a tad longer so it would reach the plug I use in my printing area. One other issue for me is that the print cartridges for this printer seem expensive for a cheaper printer.One more odd thing worth mentioning is that the tray does extend (though hard to find) but even for regular size letter paper, it pushes open the back cover tray cover. Not really an issue for me, it's just not something I've noticed.If you're fairly tech savvy and need an inexpensive printer for monochrome printing, this really isn't bad. However, if you aren't tech savvy and can't figure out set up without written instructions, look elsewhere or look for a video or instructions online.Pros:** Print Quality** Wireless Capability** Duplex Printing** Good Print SpeedCons ** Size ** Set up** Cord Length** Tray opens back cover for regular size paper** Ink Replacement Cost"

We connected the printer direct to our Win 7 desktop PC and the computer detected the printer immediately and automatically loaded the software drivers to make it run. We then connected our Win 8 and Win 10 laptops to it thru the wireless connections following the directions that came with the printer... and after a reboot on the laptops, the printer was available. It is fairly simple to do if you follow the directions.This is a nice printer for a family that does not print very often. We would buy the expensive ink carts for our bubble jet printer and they would dry out and plug jets. Then we would buy more ink carts and spend hours trying to get the plugged jets to function good enough for a print job and then have the whole process repeat again. The ink jet printers were way, way too much maintenance for us. This laser printer won't have ANY of those issues!!! Very happy!My neighbor has a similar Lexmark printer that is 6 years old and he hasn't had any issues with it. He has been buying generic toner carts at a fraction of the cost of OEM toner carts, and they work well.If you don't need super fast office printer speed, then this is a good printer for home or a small business."

Where I ran into issues is forgetting that the cartridge had security tapes on it that needed to be removed and nowhere was there any information that the security tape was on the cartridge and needed to be removed.So when I had got to the last step to print a calibration page, it was giving me a setup error. Got that done and everything worked fine after that.As for the setup. Because you have only a small toggle and display, it will be pretty difficult to navigate through to connecting to your network and then putting in your password. Fortunately for me, for this printer, the Wifi network it was going on had a numeric password so it was not that bad. But it was like having to use your tv remote to put in the numbers and toggle through every alphabet per numeric sequence. So you can imagine this part taking longer than it needs to.It did ask me if I wanted to do mobile setup. So maybe that would have prevented this cumbersome setup method.But once I got it connected to the network, all the other computers were able to connect to it.The print quality is great. And it prints fast.For the price and quality, I consider this to be a great value. Years of good use are expected from this Lexmark monochrome printer."

The printer reported a 29.43 error about cartridge packaging material still being present. I checked carefully twice, but I had removed all the packaging material. I could not get past this error. LexMark tech support was closed, and they had a non-useful web page about this error, leading me to believe that this may be a common manufacturing defect.Printers are problematic enough when they have been in use for months and years, so I don't want a printer that has problems when it is brand new.

Set up was not easy, but I wouldn't call it difficult. I will update this once I have attempted a multipage document and buy my first replacement toner. Thus far I am very satisfied with its results.I printed a full color 39 page double sided document over WiFi. The document includes color graphs, color and black and white text, images, and color tables. From the time I pressed the print button until it completed printing was 4 minutes and 30 seconds.

I've wasted so much money on bad inkjet printers that clog over time not to mention all the ink cartridges. I run a small business and need a printer only sporadically for invoicing and bulk photo printing. The review...1. The setup was not without it's challenges. You just need to make sure that you connect the Wifi to the printer first through the printer control panel then proceed with downloading the appropriate drivers/apps for your device. I found it really easy to connect the devices actually. My Google phone and Chromebook latched on immediately. I could see how others could have issues figuring this out though. I'm fairly tech savvy but it still took me a few minutes of fiddling. I don't understand the lack of included instructions out of the box or online. You really just need a small note card that could walk you through it but nothing, weird. The printing software is nothing to write home about and typically no frills.2. Quality for text is very good of course since it's a laser. Photos are okay. They aren't as poppy or crisp as most inkjets in the same price range but it's passable, at least for my needs. I didn't expect too much for the photo printing (due to reviews I read) but it actually met or exceeded my expectations. If photos are your main interest then you shouldn't be looking at a laser anyway.3. Although this is compact compared to other laser printers, it's not exactly small. It takes up as much space as a small multifunction inkjet. The advantage is that I can shove this unit into a shelf because it doesn't have a scanner top that you need to lift. I realized over time that I use a scanner maybe once a year so I wanted forgo that function.Initially, I am super happy with this. The price is amazing!! It does exactly what I need it to do for use as a basic office printer. I've been buying inkjets all my life. I hope that I don't have to deal with clogged printer heads ever again. I was also weary of buying a 'Lexmark' since there is very little hype about this brand. But I love the no frills design and function of this unit. If I encounter issues then I will update this review. Otherwise, assume this thing is still kicking butt."

The negative -- screen is kind of small which makes it difficult to read and in the past I have personally used and owned inkjet so the unit was a lot heavier then Im used to. I don't know how the toner cartridges are set up in terms of black and if the color are all in one or separate.The primary purpose of me purchasing a laserjet is I got tired of the inkjets clogging and so far I am very pleased with that aspect and the overall performance of this lexmark printer. To me it was well worth the almost literal few dollars extra for piece of mind in knowing it so far is dependable in printing if I don't print for a week, or two or more.

And again, the printing is clean and clear, both B&W and color. Printer tray holds 250 sheets, which is average for most of today's printers. I'd love if it would hold an entire ream, but if that's my only complaint, I have no real complaint.I used an Okidata C5200 laser printer for more than a decade and it performed GREAT. So after it finally gave up the ghost I bought another Oki, but I was very disappointed. I've since tried Brother and HP, but for color printing, this Lexmark seems to have all its ducks in a row.

One was a toner printer and the other an inkjet. In comparison, this laser printer is much faster and prints a higher quality image. Also, the color quality is far more consistent than with my ink jet. Its size is similar to the other two but this is far heavier. My postal service carrier had to get my husband to carry it for her. It is also much noiser than the other two, by a lot! Setup took me about 30 minutes. It was not plug-n-play by any means. I am not computer savvy so this may be easier for other people. My network found the printer immediately however, it said the driver was not working. My computer showed the correct driver was installed but would not connect the two. I tried downloading the driver from Lexmark's website but could not find one comparable with windows 10. Eventually, I used the set up disk included with the printer and it worked. Inconvinent if, like me, your computer does not have a disc drive.For my phone, I had to download the lexmark app for it connect to the printer. I'm not sure if there is a way to use it from my android without the app; this was simply the easiest way I could find to get it up and running. It does require the print jobs to pass over other networks on the way to the printer. Not the most effective or secure way to print.Update: the printer is constantly coming offline. I called customer support about the issue. Explaining that I was trying to print from my smartphone, customer support said they needed access to my laptop to diagnose the problem. After screen sharing, he opened the admin log reports for my entire computer and said the issue was with the error reports I had not addressed. Mind you, these reports were for my computer, not the printer and included things like a crash report for my office software. Customer support then said the only way to fix the printer was for me to pay one of their techs to fix the log report on my computer. What?! What is customer support for if they don't trouble shoot AND help fix the issue? The gentleman was rude in his reply and told me if I didn't want to pay that was my decision. Then he hung up. Umm okay. I have put my old reliable printer back up. At least the customer service with my other printer brand is helpful and the machine works, even if it is ancient."

This replacement printer is FASTER, SMALLER, and QUIETER than what it's replacing-- which was an HP CP2025.It was very well boxed for shipping, unpacked easily, was not damaged in shipping and nothing had moved around.Unpacking is easy. It slid out easily and the protective materials over the toners was easier to remove than most printers. The tape was minimal and I was on my way in no time.Setup was a breeze. It asks several questions when you turn it on to set date, time, location and to clarify whether you want to set it up with a mobile phone app or not. Easy.Windows recognized it easily as did my iPhone (AirPrint compatible!) and I didn't need to break into the book included, nor the CD that came with the driver. It couldn't have been more painless to unbox and install.Using it is also a breeze. It's much quieter than my former HP when idling, goes to sleep and wakes up faster and does the job without any paper jamming nor complaints.The only part that has taken a tiny bit of getting used to has been the single paper tray. part used for things like labels or envelopes. It works very well. It prints on thicker media very fast compared to my HP, but I do miss a bit of a wing to prop up heavier, floppier or thicker singles of paper. They never fall out and the printer seems to grip on them right way, so there is no deficiency here, just difference.The thing is super attractive to look at, does everything I need it to with expediency, and while it's a full 10 years more youthful than my HP, it seems to be better built.The place where I work uses Lexmark for their most challenging, difficult environments and for the most complex print jobs like GLM printing, and they hold up. I'm really happy with this printer and I trust it will do very well for me for a long time."

They are nearly reliable (except when they break, run out of ink, mysteriously stop responding to commands like ""PRINT""...etc.) and slow and steady. Did I mention slow?So I was pretty thrilled to installer this Lexmark Color Laser Printer. A million years ago, when laser printers first came out (and my pet dinosaur roamed the earth), I remember how clean and crisp the printing appeared on the page . Only large institutions could afford laser printers way back then. Now ordinary mortals can.Now: the printer was easy to install. There's a cool little pamphlet with pictures detailing the instructions--no words! If you can follow the pictures, you're all set. The pictures even tell you what's recyclable. Awesome. However, there's a bar-code scanner for your phone to register the printer--decided to register the printer by phone on the spur of the moment. And some of the choices were a bit fuzzy; it asked for country and there was no place to CHOOSE my country. Things like that. More about the phone app in a second.Once the printer was installed, the Lexmark was MAGICAL. It printed in seconds flat. It took three seconds to print a full color print--crisp, beautiful. The printing for a full page was clean, no bleeding from the edges, and all the words were black and fine. The speed was astounding.However, the android app was really needs improvement. Some people do tons of printing from their phones nowadays, and if you do, you may have a problem with this app. First of all, the photos didn't print in color from my phone. They all printed in black-and-white. Lovely black-and-white, but they ARE color photos. Also, I can't print document from phone (only photo, camera, web page or clipboard). It would be great to be able to print a PDF or Word doc., for example, but it does not seem possible from the phone app. Granted, I did not try to troubleshoot at all. But I would really prefer that these kinks had been worked out before putting the app out to the public, because I'd like to have these capabilities at my fingertips immediately.The printer itself is terrific. I love it--it's fast and the printing is gorgeous. However, the app needs some work."
R3D3NT5A6EC7XQ,"July 18, 2019",Rock Edge,Vine Customer,5,C3326dw,N/A,18,0,No,"Beefy, reliable laser printer.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D3NT5A6EC7XQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T3H979V,," The Lexmark C3326dw arrived in an Amazon box just slightly larger than the manufacture box. 4 pieces of tape, a protected cartridge liner removal and easy pull away cartridge setup tabs later, I was ready to plug it in.To load paper, pull the entire tray out and load from back (it has a slight slant), holds about half a ream of paper.You can go wireless, with a network cable or USB (neither included). For this unit I’m going Wi-Fi.Power on asks if you want to set up via a mobile device, which directs you to the Lexmark Mobile Assistant app on your phone (I had to go install it). Using that app, you set up via Wi-Fi direct by finding the printer in your Wi-Fi connections and connecting (temporarily) to it.It will then search for wireless networks. It quickly found my 2.4 GHz network (not my 5 GHz). Typed in my password and we were done.If you can get the app to work, trust me, you’ll be happy. The manual ‘set it up from the console’ only has left and right arrows with an OK button to advance the letter system. So typing in any kind of lengthy or difficult password will take a hot minute!Clicking the power button puts it in a kind of sleep mode and to power it off completely hold the power button down for about 5 seconds.Once the printer was fully configured, I did a power on time test. From completely turned off, a click of the power button to ‘status ready’ took 53 seconds in Wi-Fi mode. I tested when configured via network cable and exactly the same time.Next up: the PC install. I tried to find ‘just the driver’ on the cd but the Lexmark installer is pretty much going to have to run on your local system (the web site had a more current version to download). I was thankful that at the end of the install process was a separate ‘utility’ installer for a system tray application to keep you aware of print job status, ink levels and other standard tray alerts. Thank you for not forcing it on us! But, it’s there if you like that sort of thing.The first thing I printed? My notes for this review! It was fast, I didn’t time it and only a few lines.The second thing was the image of the printer on the product page. I started the stop watch once I saw the communication light stop blinking, which is when you hear the printer spin up. Semi color page took 8 seconds.Two page document with both sides printing, 15 seconds. Same doc two pages: 10 seconds. 20 page single document B&W and Color both clocked in around 50 seconds. The attached vid shows the pace of a print jobs and the method of double-sided printing.Next I printed a color seating chart of Sun Trust field. Clicking print to finish was 15 seconds. 5 seconds communications and just under 10 seconds later it was in the tray.The printer comes with toner of course and the cartridges are going to yield approximately 500 pages for each of the Color cartridges and up to 750 pages for the Black print cartridge. Each cartridge has a model number for the ‘return’ version service and new version model numbers of standard yield and high yield. As of this posting, prices are not available on the site.Overall this was an easy to set up laser printer that is perfect for a small business or home office, could service a larger set of users easily and prints a quality sheet relatively fast. It’s got beefy stats and does what they said it would do."

I can only hope we can correct this situation for you in the future.  We appreciate your input and will look to this to help drive incremental improvements in our processes, response and timing in order to help you and any future customers resolve issues quickly and as painlessly as possible. ","This particular printer was defective when delivered. As soon as it was set up it was obvious that the print quality was very poor. After contacting Lexmark and sending examples and details (SN, proof of purchase etc) of the printer, the initial diagnosis was a faulty toner cartridge. A new toner cartridge was promised for delivery the next day. Three days later, after multiple follow ups, I received notice that it had finally shipped. That turned out to not be the problem. Further diagnosis led to a conclusion that the problem was deeper and that the unit would need additional parts replaced. Rather than simply replacing the defective printer with a new one and an apology, I was told the necessary parts would be shipped overnight and a technician would be organized to install them and ensure that the printer was fully repaired. A week later, no parts, no technician, no contact from Lexmark, and still no working printer. Returned via Amazon. Very disappointing experience. Its possible that if you happen to get a working printer, it might serve you well. But don't count on much in the way of support from Lexmark if you happen to get a dud."

Fast, good colors. It's similar to an HP I also have (m454). Large toner cartridges. Good color. The color is great for anything other than photos... there is looks good, but it looks like a ""copy"", though that's partially because of the paper. If you copy or print anything that's more like diagrams or line art, the colors are great. Set up was smooth -- not quite as easy at the HP, but nothing to complain about. Print time and sound are similar to the HP. The HP is a little quieter. But since this has a scanner also, for copying, unless you only need the printer, this is a better buy than the HP."
R2S19CBIJT7PAR,"September 6, 2019",S,Vine Customer,5,MC3224adwe,N/A,1,0,No,"Solid, well-made printer",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2S19CBIJT7PAR?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"I got this Lexmark after my last printer died on me, and I’m pretty glad I did. It’s really well made, offers a ton of great features, and looks pretty good on my desk. While my needs for this printer aren’t many (I have another printer for my home office), it’s worked really well for me so far and I’d be happy to recommend it.Pros:When printing the black text shows up crisp and clear on the page, proving immediately that it’s a quality piece of equipment. It’s bold and punchy, and I haven’t had any trouble reading anything I’ve printed yet. The color printing for photos and images is pretty good, though I’ve seen much better from other printers. It’ll work just fine as long as printing color isn’t your main objective. After setup, the printer easily connects to my devices (Macbook, Android) without fail, and I’ve absolutely never had a problem.I love that the printer is so quiet - it doesn’t even wake my sleeping pets when they’re in the same room! The scanning feature is pretty easy to use and self explanatory with a regular speed. The small touchscreen is easy to use and lends a modern feel to the machine. Everything on the machine is high quality, and it feels like it’s made to last. Nothing flimsy whatsoever.Cons:As mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t recommend this printer if photos and color-use are your main objectives. While the printer works fine for these things, the vibrance is notably less than for my previous printer (Epson Workforce Pro WF-4630). This feels nitpicky, but I’d really have expected a larger paper tray from a printer of this size and price.Setup took a little longer than I’d prefer - you have to install a driver and painstakingly connect the printer to all your devices. Again, once setup, you’re good to go, but know that you’ll be sitting down for a good half hour or so to get it all working. For home use, I find the printer size a bit much. It appears to me a little smaller in the photos, so I was surprised when it arrived and I had to find a bigger spot for it.Overall, though, it’s a pretty good product. I’d happy suggest it."

No print driver needed for Macs or Chromebooks",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4KQUR0SC0NNZ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,,"Before unboxing this, I tried several times to find a print driver for the Mac (since every other printer we've had has needed a print driver, and although the printer comes with a CD, my MacBook Pro, running the latest version of Mojave, doesn't have a disc drive), but had no luck, although the description indicates that this printer works with Mac systems, in addition to Windows and Linux, for which there were print drivers on the Lexmark site. I finally called Lexmark customer service, and was told I didn't need a print driver with a Mac or iPhone, that I could just use AirPrint, a utility I didn't know I had. The printer has worked seamlessly from two laptops and an iPhone. For reasons I didn't understand, though, I wasn't initially able to print from my first iPad on iOS v13.1.1, but after an update, I found the setting on the iPad, and was able to print without any difficulties.So, we unboxed it and got it all set up, and it works even more seamlessly than that. My husband, who printed from it before I did, and is using an older Mac system, High Sierra, was given the option to use AirPrint, and was able to print without any difficulties after giving the printer the network password. I just used Command-P, the standard Apple print command, got a print window, deselected the old printer, was given the option to use this printer (even though I'd never printed on it from this computer), and got a beautiful, double-sided printout with colour illustrations. The print quality is excellent, better than any from our previous printer, including the last, an inkjet which forgets it ever knew our network much more often than not. Printing from our ancient Chromebook, even for the first time, was just as easy. We've had no issues with the printer forgetting our network, so I'm sure it was the previous printer, not the network. All of the printouts have been perfect. Digital scanning has also worked very well, as does copying.This comes with starter toner cartridges which are intended to be recycled through Lexmark. I have no idea yet how long they last.This is a truthful and conscientious review, not influenced by my having received the product free in exchange for giving an honest review."

Balck and white copies are, as expected, clear and sharp. color copies are quite good also. They are not the professional high-resolution photos you get with a photo inkjet printer but for purposes more than acceptable. The quality of laser printing has advanced over the year. It still is not as good as black and white but is certainly acceptable. It comes with starter toner' regular toner cartridges are priced on a par with competitors.

I've set it up in home home office where I am constantly printing and faxing documents throughout the day. The machine was pretty simple to get setup on my WiFi network using the Lexmark Mobile setup app available on apple and android. I suggest using the app as it's much easier than typing on the small touchscreen.The touchscreen responds quickly and is visually appealing. It can be customized with most frequently used features such as scan, fax and email. PC drivers and software was easy to install and had no issues setting up on my 2 laptops and my desktop. I can seamlessly print from all of my devices and applications.Faxing is a breeze using the top loading self feeder tray. Once the fax task is complete the machine prints out a fax log which includes your cover page (or whatever your first page was) along with the status, time, page count and number sent to.Scanning can be done from the auto feeder tray or the flat panel (I prefer the auto feeder). Print quality is outstanding, crisp clear printing every time and super fast. I formerly used an ink-jet all in one and printing took forever. The only downside I've noticed is with scanning files to a PC or mobile device. My previous machine I could put my documents into the feeder, sit at my desk and just scan to my computer or mobile device. After scanning I could tweak if needed, send as email etc.With this Lexmark when you scan from a PC or mobile device it makes you ""approve"" the job on the printer itself which to me defeats the purpose of scanning from my PC if I have to go back to the printer to OK the scan. Something I hope a software or firmware patch can fix.Overall This multi-function laser printer is a great investment and makes daily tasks much faster without reducing quality."

R17VSGRBVIPEJF,"July 12, 2019",tachi1,Vine Customer,4,B2236dw,N/A,0,0,No,Many pluses from size and price to print quality and speed,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17VSGRBVIPEJF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,,"The printer comes with an installation cd but no printed information. This leads to some confusion. The cd installs scanner software, but the printer is not a scanner. There is a power button in front which lights up white but, in order to print you need an unlabeled blue light to be lit and the power light in front to be off. For the blue light to come on you need to press the OK button, the power light turns off, and “Ready” appears on the digital display. Granted, it’s not hard to learn, but it’s hardly intuitive or logical. On the website, I read that it has an ‘active’ and a ‘sleep’ mode.’ Maybe this is an explanation for the weird light situation.There is also a slight confusion in the process of setting up the paper tray. There is a rather stiff blue spring control that you need to press (hard) to take it to letter size (or legal or A4). Once you get past that, it’s uphill from there. The printing quality and speed are great. The ease of printing two-sided is also a great plus. In addition to the paper tray which pulls out from the bottom and holds an impressive amount of paper, there is an additional tray for manual feeding in case you need to print an envelope or a different size of paper than what you have loaded on the tray. When you’re on the printing dialog, just select page setup and you get to select which tray you want. If you don’t select page setup the default is to feed paper from the main tray.All in all, it’s a great little printer. It fits anywhere; it prints fast and sharp; one toner will yield about 6,000 pages; and it will work as a wireless printer or connected via USB from your computer or phone or other device. On the whole, it’s a solid performer at a reasonable price."

It can connect with wired Ethernet, wireless, or USB. It can print one-sided or duplex (both sides of a page). My overall rating is 3-1/2 stars because of the Cons listed below. If Lexmark fixes those or even some, I would give this printer 5 stars.Setup:After removing all the tape that holds things together for shipping, you'll pull the toner cartridge - along with the drum - out of the front panel and remove both the paper protecting the drum and the activating strip from the toner cartridge. Put them back then plug in the cord and use the display to set region, date, and time. Now you need to install the driver from the included disc.I installed the driver from the disc, but the setup software could not detect the printer on my network (wireless). I went into setup on the printer and connected it to my wireless network. This can take a bit of time as you have to scroll through the alphabet for each character of your network password.Afterward, I went to the install screen on my computer and installed the printer using the IP address. Now it works. Put paper in the tray. You have to move the dividers around before you paper will fit. And, oddly, the tray protrudes from the back of the printer with letter size paper.Printing:I printed a two page Word document using duplex printing. The printer is very fast and automatically reverses the page to print the back side. The printer defaults to duplex printing which is probably not your default preference. You'll have to select single side printing in Printer Setup in your program and you'll have to do this for each different document. Anyone know how to set single side printing as default? Setting it in the printer configuration via the IP address does nothing.Whenever I send a document to the printer, a popup appears telling me the SMTP server is not setup. The document prints anyway.The print quality is excellent. Fonts are crisp and clean. While not photo quality, pictures are still very detailed with very good tonal range.I was able to print a document from my phone using Lexmark Mobile App.Miscellaneous:I had to search Lexmark's website for the user manual.

The 8½ x 11 inch paper wouldn’t fit in the paper tray & we had to feed it one sheet at a time. It’s supposed to be able to handle 8.5 x 14 inch paper, too but I don’t see how it’ll fit. I pushed & pulled & examined it from every angle & I couldn’t get the paper tray to take a small stack of regular typing paper. The size of this printer is 17.4 x 12.3 x 16.5 inches and it weights 15 lbs."
R6XLFWLEVQAJO,"July 3, 2019",Robert J. Newell,Vine Customer,4,B2236dw,N/A,1,0,No,Not bad for a low end printer once you set it up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6XLFWLEVQAJO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07N23D92N,,"This is one of many low-end laser printers now on the market. As things go, it isn't bad for the money, but don't expect performance equal to your workgroup printer at the office.The best feature is duplex printing, which is common these days, but not always at the current selling price of this printer. Duplex printing worked as expected. Just don't expect the exaggerated printing speed listed in the product description. You won't get 30+ pages a minute duplex, or even simplex for that matter. We got maybe half that speed. That still isn't bad, though. We're talking four or five seconds a page, which for home use isn't bad at all.Construction is about as you'd expect. This is not one to typically last for years and years. But we've been surprised before (we have a cheap Brother printer that's run for nine years of light use). Still, if you get three or four years out of it, it's well worth it.Setup. Ah yes. It's best to try to get it to run natively if possible. Drivers are hit and miss and depend on your operating system. To make a long story short we can run it on our Linux system as a wired printer but we're still struggling with wireless. Your mileage will vary depending on your operating system. We're pretty sure you'll be eventually be able to get it to work, but if you're not a computer person you will likely end up calling on a knowledgeable friend. Plug and play is not guaranteed.In inexpensive printers such as these the biggest cost is toner cartridges, which often run as much as replacing the printer entirely. Seek out third party cartridges which can cost as little as one-sixth as much. Read reviews to assess quality, of course.Bottom line: four stars. A decent low-price printer once you get it working."

I have had this printer less than one year, and the duplex feature has broken. The printer still tries to force duplexing often, but as it goes to pull the paper back in after printing the first side, it jams every time. I cannot turn off the double-sided printing on the printer (and have it stay that way). I have to remember every time I print (which is a big time-waster) to turn it off.-------------------I am amending my review after using this printer for awhile. I changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars. It takes some getting used to.I was used to just putting things in the manual feed slot (checks, envelopes, special paper, etc.) and my old printer would always auto-select it when it sensed something there. This one, you need to make sure your print option is manual feed to avoid problems/jams.It still always defaults to duplex when I don't want it, making my print twice sometimes and waste more paper than its green ""enviro-leaf"" symbol is trying to save, but oh well, the wacky world we live in now.---------------------------------[old review below]I run a busy small office. I keep a printer on my desktop for small jobs, printing checks, and envelopes, and I send large jobs to my network printer. I have used this printer for a few weeks now.First the good:This printer is fast and the print quality is good.The bad:1. The separate single feed slot that I use for checks and envelopes doesn't draw well and has to be almost always separately selected when a job is sent to print. It jams all the time. A big waste of time and this problem alone means that I would never recommend this printer.2. When regular letter-sized paper is put in the main tray, you have to open the rear door of the printer (like you were using over-sized paper) and leave it open, else the main tray won't fit in.3. I don't duplex much of my work, but it keeps reverting to duplexing after every time I change the settings (I guess it's trying to force ""saving the planet"" on me, instead of allowing me to use it how best works for my business)"

At first I was very concerned over the cost of the cartridges. After using it for a while now I am extremely concerned over the cost of the cartridges and the actual pages you get per cartridge.I am printing shipping labels with this printer in black and white. I got about 170 lables with the partial cartridge that it comes with. Today I ordered the third black cartridge from Lexmark. According to the printer count I have printed a total of 766 pages and have used up the starter cartridge and one of the brand new full cartridges. This is an absolutely miserable page count considering Lexmark claims I should be getting 1500+ pages per cartridge.The only reason I went with this printer was because I used to run a Lexmark 250DN printer here in the office. We got well over 1000 pages on each cartridge with that old printer. Guess newer isn't always better. Sad.

Wireless capable and fast.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGN6CJJRKWO81?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"This is a nice compact color printer. It also allows you to scan, fax and copy. The printer can copy/scan/print in 600dpi but if you use the photo settings you can get results that look better than 600dpi. It will not produce the results you would expect from a photo printer but it can produce nice quality output if you use the right settings.The touch screen is also in color and is bright and clear. (you can see it at an angle easily as well) It is nice to scroll through the menus like you would on your smartphone. (touch and drag)The scanner seems to make images a little brighter and a more 'washed out' than the original in some cases. The software comes with a TWAIN-compliant driver that will let you import images into your favorite graphics manipulation program. (like Photoshop for example) I was able to scan photos with close to photo-quality output by selecting the Photo Mode from the menu of the TWIAN driver and changing the dpi setting to 600. The image looked better than 600dpi but it did scan in 600dpi. The full 8.5x11 sheet was 5100 x 6600 pixels. (if you divide the pixels by 600 it ends up being 8.5 x 11)For office or home use, it is a great little printer as long as you aren't expecting it to print photo quality. One nice thing about a laser printer is that it can sit of years without issues, unlike an inkjet where the ink can dry and cause issues if it is not used frequently.The printer was easy to install and comes with an actual CD/DVD. (you can find the driver on Epson's website very easily if you do not have a DVD drive on your computer) It can also be set up to print from a phone over WiFi. My experience with printing from a phone is that it is a last resort since the phone itself limits the control you have over the print output.In summary, the printer only prints in 600dpi but some kind of enhancement is going on that makes photos look better than 600dpi when it is used. Even with those settings, it does not with photo quality results. For graphics, text and even photo-like quality, it is a great all-around multifunction.The printer goes to sleep on its own after a bit so to use it wirelessly you may need to power it on. It can be used as a scanner though it can only scan at 600dpi. (photo mode enhances the image for photos) I haven't tried the fax functionality since I do not fax much. The copier functionality is slick. You can navigate through the menus to get the optimal settings.It does everything I would expect it to do. The photo enhancements from photo mode produced very nice results for 600dpi, even though the output is not photo quality. I printed a picture of my friend's Camaro on regular copy paper for reference."

This Lexmark has so far fit the bill well with it compact size, quiet operation, and fast printing capability. There are many features packed into this printer, all of which is controlled on the almost over-sensitive touch screen (perhaps my fingers are just too big). Setup was fairly straightforward for me and I didn't need any assistance. Wired and wireless connections work very well and I have had zero problems with wireless connections.Print quality is excellent for text, and so-so for images. However, if you are looking to print quality images, that is where an inkjet will still be handy. For that reason, my old inkjet will stick around strictly for printing images.Lexmark also offers an exchange program for their toner cartridges, saving the consumer about 25%. You purchase a toner cartridge from Lexmark, in exchange for your old one. However, it appears that of the time of this review, it is currently unavailable.Overall, for a home, or even office, this is an excellent printer. Even if you don't print often at all, but need the printer to work at the snap of your fingers, I would suggest this laser printer over an inkjet because unlike ink, toner won't dry out and become waste. You will pay the price upfront, but over the life of the printer, you will more than make up for the cost in the long run."

They are not extremely heavy printers but tend to also need to do some occasional scanning, were interested in the idea of being able to fax medical paperwork when they can't upload in an app, and liked the idea of not having to replace ink continually. So we're in business with this printer.Hardware: Very well constructed, more durably made than your average HP or Canon these days.Packing: Very well packed in materials that did not get damaged nor have issues during shipping.Unpacking: Very easy to slide out of the box, no acrobatics requiredSetup: Setup is very easy. I used the menu rather than an app or installing things on a computerAfter setup and installing the local drivers and configuring them, the printer is very responsive for printing even though its allowed to sleep most of the time. It also works well with AirPrint which is fantastic!The LCD screen is bright, color, and easy to use. The touch buttons are also very easy to use. The functionality of the scanner, toner loading, other physical functions are easy. Double side printing is very easy.This was almost a 5 star review but there were a couple software issues that got in the way and I'm sure will be resolved with software updates.1. When setting up the fax, no matter how many times I named the fax, it wouldn't save. I had to skip it and do it later by navigating the menu.2. The printer for some reason came thinking it's main paper tray was ""colored paper"" which caused every single computer I set up to cause the printer to throw an error every time they tried to print to ""plain paper"" which is the default for every printer in the world forever and always for it's main paper tray-- I'd guess this was a setup bug/error.3. I cannot for the life of me get the software and driver for Windows 10 to recognize this model of printer to display a scanning utility. I'm expecting this to be solved by a software update as well. I know this printer was listed as ""just announced"" on the web site. The driver installs fine, I can print fine, but when I open the utility for scanning it says no compatible models found. Even Windows 10 recognizes the scanning device but...So summary: The printer is fantastic, I love it, I wouldn't hesitate on buying but only if scanning over the network is absolutely essential, and I'd guess that should be solved soon. I'll update if I know it's fixed in a software update."

Just download the app, follow the 2 instructions, and you're done. Yup... that easy. I spent 3 hours trying to figure out what I needed to do next in order to set it up and the answer was: nothing. It's literally the best setup for a network printer I've ever seen.I've been using a Dell color laser for several years and it was time to upgrade. It was still a good printer, but with the increase in print quality that is now available, and reduction in size, it was time to upgrade. This Lexmark printer wasn't just an incremental upgrade, it was a giant step forward for print quality. I'm able to print photo quality prints on plain paper. (If I was doing a finished product I'd still use laser photo paper)It's fast, quiet, and works seamlessly with all of my computer, and mobile, applications.One thing to note that frustrated me a bit was the scanner. Now follow with me on this before you judge. I've tried multiple times to scan remotely from my PC and it simply won't work while the machine is in sleep mode. It's like the network won't recognize the scan function while it sleeps. Then, I thought about it for a second. Why would I scan something if I wasn't standing by the printer putting whatever I want to scan on the machine? So unless I missing something, it really isn't a big deal.I also can't seem to scan multiple pages into one document as the model I purchased doesn't have the sheet feeder. The windows scanner app doesn't allow it, which is a pain in the neck and not Lexmark's fault. Happily, the mobile app that Lexmark provides does allow for this functionality, so there is an easy workaround.I do wish I would have gotten the sheet feeder though, so if you scan multiple page documents, don't be silly like me and say, ""I don't need the sheet feeder,"" because you probably will.All in all, wonderful printer that I would highly recommend. 5-stars!"

It definitely doesn't have the flimsy, plastic-y feel some other printers have. However, it's also not as bulky as other business-level multifunction printers. Setup was ridiculously easy, according to the picture-only quick start guide: remove the shipping tape from it, plug it in, and turn it on. There is a mobile app you can use to configure your printer (Lexmark Mobile Assistant), but it's not really necessary.The touch screen is clear and responsive, and even with my fat fingers, I'm able to use it easily. The scanner is fast, able to scan and print a color page in less than 30 seconds from warm-up to page in hand. When it comes to printing, this thing is a machine gun. I printed a 10 page doc in less than 30 seconds, and while saying it is one thing, watching it print is something else. The prints are crisp and clear, with no toner smudging or dust anywhere.Someone else mentioned there's no USB cable included (the only cable in the box is the power supply), so be aware of that. I connected mine wirelessly, and as mentioned, setup was a snap and took less than 5 minutes. This is a really solid printer that does everything you'd expect, and does it well."

I also have a higher resolution inkjet which I will keep on standby for photographic projects, but the Lexmark laser has now been assigned as my workhorse for label printing and creating crisp documents. The print quality is noticeably better when printing text only.I love that there is no extendable document tray to get in the way or to have to remember to pull out to prevent papers from dropping to the floor: printed documents are delivered neatly underneath the scanner bed.The printer initiates quickly after a job has been sent, almost instantaneously over wireless network or USB (both tested), and the printing is quick and efficient.The manual feed is easy to use and auto-selects when I tested with an envelope, with no prompt asking which feed or tray to choose from. There is also a handy icon at the manual feed next to the sliding size guide, so you'll never put your paper or envelopes in upside down or back to front.As expected, the scanner takes a little time to process at its maximum DPI of 600, but no more than the average scanner. The output is clean and good quality.The copier works well and also has a good quality output. Speed is average.The touchscreen user interface is easy to read and intuitive.This straightforward color laser printer perfectly suits my needs as I don't scan or copy handfuls of documents at a time. If you do, be sure to check out the version of this printer that has the automatic document feed (ADF) so you don't have to babysit the machine with manual input by constantly opening the scanner bed cover and switching or turning over documents. It also comes at higher cost. Otherwise, this model handles a good amount of output and is perfectly suitable for most environments if your main function is printing."
R1CWRFQ3973X5V,"July 20, 2019",Loren Woirhaye,Vine Customer,2,MC3224dwe,N/A,19,1,No,color laser printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1CWRFQ3973X5V?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T1DQNNS,,"update 11/3/2019. The printer became unable to communicate with the computer and drivers had to be removed and reinstalled. This is the second time the printer has done this and I really don't use it much. I'm giving up on using it wirelessly and I'll use the cable from now on.###Easy, nearly effortless setup. I had the machine up and running in maybe 20 minutes including downloading and installing drivers and connecting to a wireless network. It was difficult to enter the wireless password accurately due to tiny ""keys"" on the touchscreen. Thankfully this is not the sort of task that needs doing very often. It includes a software CD but my current PC lacks a drive so I had to download it.No printer cable was included. The manual as such was a sheaf of loose papers with illustrations shwoing pretty much just how to take the packing tape off and a few pages of written cautions.Printing or copying proceeds quickly. Copying is no slower than a photocopier, though I haven't used one in awhile so they may have improved. Color copies come out washed out in light places and oversaturated in darker areas. Basically it doesn't handle contrast well when copying and I wasn't able to find an adjustment for that. Your color copies are going to look like copies, not like they came off a file. Black and white copies fared better.If you're looking for easy use, speed, convenience and competitive price, this could be the right printer for you. Just don't expect much of it as a color copier. I didn't test it by scanning, saving a file and printing. That would be one workaround that would allow a user to color/contrast correct scanned images before printing.The included toner cartridges are labeled as ""starter"" cartridges and presumably have less toner in them than replacements will. Lexmark has a trade-in program for recycling cartridges that will save you about $15 on each of the four. 1500 page replacement cartridges are as little as about $75 with the trade-in and as much as about $99 without, from Lexmark. The black toner model number is c3210k0 if you want to look into replacement costs.I did not test the double sided print function but assume it works.While it worked beautifully on initial wireless setup, the second time I used it to print ( I do not print often) it didn't work and I had to uninstall and reinstall the wireless software or driver. Since then it has connected every time but I think one should be aware that like any wireless peripheral it can let you down when least expected."

R1LVMAR6YBYF7X,"July 23, 2019",Doc H,Vine Customer,4,MC3224adwe,N/A,36,0,No,An Excellent Home/Small Business Laser Printer,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LVMAR6YBYF7X?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T4LGDGQ,,"As a preface, Lexmark, the company, got out of the inkjet printer business in 2012. They were known for making fairly decent inkjets, with expensive proprietary ink (a business model Lexmark pioneered), complicated to set up and not always user friendly. There were also a series of complicated acquisitions and mergers following, with the resulting Lexmark of today. Now exclusively manufacturing laser printers in that product line, it is reassuring to note that not all of their inkjet reputation has followed them.This particular laser printer (MC3224adwe) is a reasonably good example of their product line. I set it up on a PC with a 64-bit Windows 10 OS – so to clarify, MAC users may have a different experience. Setup was fairly straightforward, with the exception of some hiccups with the mobile app setup (which the printer screen pops up and suggests) – as in it never connected to the network. I was able to connect with a USB cable, and subsequently to the network through the printer interface however, and the connection was solid and stable. My home network is a Linksys mesh, with about 50 connected devices and a 4T server, and so far no conflicts. The printer is configurable through the onboard screen interface as well as the Lexmark software (which actually follows my historical Lexmark experience – no frills, basic software, with not a lot of graphic flash and user prompts). Don’t count on a print preview with this software either, outside the Windows Print interface – your document will print as soon as the printer spools up, which actually takes a little more time than an inkjet. Multiple settings can be controlled and somewhat adjusted on the fly (like changing from 1 to 2-sided printing), although you may need to scroll through multiple menu screens to get what you want.As far as the printer hardware, the unit itself is pretty hefty – just over 40 pounds – but not much bigger than the Epson 4740 space it now occupies – maybe a shade deeper and taller. Laser printers have come a long way from back in the day they needed their own – large – cart. It does not have a telephone bypass, so if you fax a lot you will need a dedicated line, although in a pinch you can use a cable splitter and connect to your landline paired with your phone. The bad news is there is nothing in the software that let’s the printer detect an incoming call distinct from a fax, so if you're used to having your fax printer connected to your single phone line, and only pick up when a fax comes in (as many inkjet small business printers accommodate), you're out of luck. The solution is to temporarily turn off the analog fax, then turn it on when you need it, but again, several menu screens to accomplish. There is actually a marked space for a bypass (an “out"" connection for a phone cable), but it’s covered by a metal plate - so I assume it may be possible to add it later. As a dedicated fax it works well.The other, minor, quirk, is the paper feed bin, which is an ungenerous 250-sheet tray, mysteriously unlabeled, although the manual feed tray just above it is printed with the number “1.” The larger paper bin is, in fact, “Tray 1” when you sort out the defaults, but you wouldn't be able to tell from the instructions because there are none – just a couple of sheets of graphic images of the printer detailing stages of setup, sort of historical Lexmark hilarity. You can, after you figure it out, feed single sheets or envelopes manually through the single feed tray labeled “1.”The scanner function works through the onboard printer menu, and gives you a popup screen on your computer with basic scan functions using the Windows Fax and Scan utility– and you can scan to file, print, fax or email – from the document feeder or flatbed. It does allow you to scan in a variety of formats, but, being Windows, not directly to a PDF. Printing itself is fairly straightforward as well, and it's actually very easy to print directly from a mobile device, phone or tablet, without going through a dozen servers – kudos. The rated output is 24ppm, and that’s probably pretty accurate; 2-sided printing is the default, but configurable to 1 or 2, and it does it very well. That's slightly faster than a similarly configured business inkjet printer, and you can get this printer identically configured to print 26ppm as the MC3326 (more expensive). It's not apparent from the description, but it doesn't do straight duplex (2-sided) copies, but the more complicated copy each side, then combine. Print quality is good, but benefited by using laser paper – one of the true advantages of an inkjet is that it will print equally well on just about any thickness or texture of paper – don’t try that with a laser, but the strength of a laser is that it will print crisp text down to the tiniest font on the right paper. Color photos are also not a strength of laser printers, so if you are a dedicated photographer this is not your go-to, but it does a decent job of printing color photos up to about a 4800 cq (about 2400x600 dpi) resolution and 8x10, and particularly on glossy laser paper, with a good default color balance.And then there's the cost. Energy-wise, an inkjet or a laser printer use a negligible amount of electricity, because they essentially shut down after use. Expendable ink supplies are another matter. The toner cartridges for this printer cost almost $100 each, and it requires four. A full replacement set costs more than the printer, retail (though not unlike a comparable inkjet comparison). Lexmark does have an eco-friendly (and budget-friendly) exchange program for toner, which saves about 25% off that, although it doesn't seem to be currently available for this printer – maybe later. Compared to about $40 retail for inkjet replacement cartridges (and you also need four) for the Epson 4740 Workforce, an equivalent home/small business inkjet printer. This would seem to be quite a disparity, until you factor in the cost per print. The inkjet cartridges are rated over 600 pages each (sometimes more), but if you've used an inkjet, you know you’re unlikely to get the rated output. Inkjet ink dries out, requiring the printer to cycle and clean the heads periodically. You'll likely need to manually clean them at least once through the life of a cartridge, maybe more, especially with infrequent use. And probably realign the heads, also using ink. So don't count on the rated pages for an inkjet cartridge – 50 to 75 percent is more realistic. A laser toner cartridge will literally last years, in or out of the printer, used or unused, and the cartridges for this printer are rated at 1,500 pages (the standard, not the included cartridges - about half that), and you will get the full number of rated pages. A caveat for both – pages for rating estimates are considered mixed text and graphics – not full photographic spreads, which will reduce rated output.So the summary is that the available laser cartridges for the Lexmark will produce likely about two or three times as many pages as the equivalent inkjet, for a slightly better cost per page, and better printed text, with the added benefit of not fiddling with head alignment or cleaning, and not worrying about leaving the cartridges in the printer for an extended period. If you are a small business with basic printing, copying and faxing needs, or a home user who prints occasionally, faxes occasionally, copies and scans occasionally, and doesn't require high-def photos, this is a solid, economical laser printer that will serve you as well or better than an inkjet. If you are a photographer who needs maximum resolution prints larger than 8x10, or routinely uses graphic arts paper, take a look at a modern dedicated inkjet, knowing you will spend more in life-cycle costs to get what you want. For most of us, the Lexmark is probably what we should have on our desk. Recommended."

Color saturation and coverage is uniform and rich. I read reviews that complained about how noisy the printer is. That has not been my experience. I only print wireless from Mac, iPhone and Windows without any connectivity problems.I had one problem. Out of the box the printer was printing a series of dots lined vertically 1/2 inch from the right edge, spaced exactly one inch apart on every page. I called Lexmark support who quickly had me run printer diagnostics (again, from the printer display panel). He determined that the problem was caused by the black toner cartridge. He shipped me a new cartridge (full size, not the starter one!), which solved the problem. While it was disappointing to have a problem like this on a brand new printer, Lexmark made up for it.

I cannot afford toner that expensive, I had just assumed there is always an aftermarket of generic toners, but this printer must not sell in high enough numbers for aftermarket companies to make toners. It will be cheaper for me to throw this away and buy another brand printer that does have aftermarket toners available.Original Review: Home printers are throw away items. They usually don't last more a year, if they do, they need new rollers, drums, etc that cost more than a new printer. My Canon Imageclass MF634cdw was flawless for one year. Got it loaded and up and running in 20 minutes. After one year it started making awful grinding noises and printing badly, etc. Time for something new.This was only $114 and has the auto duplex function. It lacks the all-in-one document feeder and scanner, but I can still use that on my old Imageclass. Setup was difficult (much harder than my Canon was), and the printer could not be detected on my wifi, so I had to google how to load a print driver using an IP address. I've never done this before. Took me about 5 hours to set this printer up on my 2 computers (desktop & laptop), but it prints quickly and quietly. Auto duplex works perfect. After 5 days, it has not gone offline, not had any paper jams, no issues at all.I will update this if I have any issues, but after 5 days, despite some annoyances in getting it up and running, I am very please for only $114."

But it is awesome so far!I'm replacing a 20-year-old high-end Brother printer, so I'll compare it to that. The Brother cost $600 20 years ago, so I was not expecting much at all from a $117 printer.Most of the negative reviews mentioned trouble connecting via WiFi. My first thought was I didn't care about that. I've never had a WiFi printer in the past and didn't see any reason it would be necessary now. However, I have gotten married since 20 years ago and we have kids and more computers in the house, so I figured if it worked that would be great and if not, well, it was only $117 and we didn't have a networked printer in the past so it would be okay.Of course, once it arrived, connecting it to WiFi became my first obsession! I guess I just wanted to try it that cool new feature!I've never connected a printer to WiFi and wasn't sure how it worked. The printed materials that came with the printer were totally useless. It's all pictures, no words and nothing about connecting via Wifi. But, all the info you need, really, is on the printer screen. Even though it's tiny, I was able to get the information I needed from it to connect it up.Basically, I turned the printer on, read the directions as they scrolled across on the tiny screen and followed the directions. It mentioned a Lexmark printer app, which I downloaded. I was able to quickly and easily connect the app on my phone to the printer and from there it was a breeze. It went through the steps and I was able to print from my phone. Which again, was not something I had ever imagined doing, much less anything I needed or wanted to do. But it worked and that was cool!Then it was off to connect two computers to it. First I plugged it in by wire to my wife's computer - which I think might have been a mistake. But at the time I thought that's how you had to do it. For some reason I wasn't able to get it to connect via WiFi on her computer because while the computer ""saw"" the printer, it kept asking me for a WPS PIN which it said was either printed on the printer or was on the printed materials that came with the printer. It was on neither.I gave up on that and went to install it via WiFi only on my computer. Actually I didn't really have to do anything. I opened the Printer Settings on my computer and clicked Add Printer, then find WiFi connected printer and it was right there. So it was already broadcasting the signal to all devices in our house and all I had to do was click Connect - and it worked like a charm. The weird thing though is it didn't ask me for any WPS PIN for my computer. And I'm guessing that's because I never connected it via wire - so it didn't halfway install itself by wire only to get confused by WiFi? I don't know. But I did not ever attach it to my computer with a wire and the WiFi connected up absolutely flawlessly.Then I went back to my wife's computer and using the disk that came with the printer I installed the drivers from that. And once that was done, suddenly it worked fine as a WiFi printer. Although it shows up in Printer Settings as (copy1) of the first attempted installation by wire, which still works if it's plugged in with the wire.Then for the big test. I moved the printer to another room! Would we both be able to print on it from our respective offices? My wife's office is closest and mine is further away... about 50 feet away and several drywall walls. From my wife's office, everything went off without a hitch. From my office - same result. Print Perfect both times.My old $600 Brother printer did excellent color prints, and this one does as well - for 1/6th the price. I printed a few photos from the Lexmark, as a test, and was absolutely amazed at their quality. They're almost photo-printer quality. In fact, if I printed them on laser photo paper, I think they'd look good enough to frame and hang.The other nifty feature is the double-sided print feature. Maybe this is something that's been common among printers for the last few years, I'm not sure. But if you're not used to it, it's very cool. It will print on both sides of the paper - automatically. In other words, you don't have to print on one side and then stick the page in upside down and print the other side manually anymore. It will print the first side, then suck the page back into the printer and print the other side! It's really amazing to watch if you've never seen a printer do this before. And it's so fast.One other plus factor is that it's much smaller and lighter than our old printer. The old one, I literally can't lift by myself it's so darn heavy. Something around 100 pounds I think. But this one is much easier to lift, it's like a heavy suitcase. We also appreciate that it takes up much less space than the old behemoth did.One con so far... they include about 7 or 8 sheets of paper (printed on both sides - that's 16 pages of printing) with nothing other than safety warnings - in every imaginable language. The length of the English text wouldn't take up more than about 2 paragraphs, not even a full page. So it's a colossal waste of paper they include and completely unnecessary. Not to mention the hassle they cause all their customers with so much extra paper they have to throw out. BIG WASTE. I have to think that the United States is their largest market and as such might warrant it's own version of this in English and perhaps Spanish. But no... they literally had to print it in almost every major language on earth - and send it in every major language to every customer! Totally ridiculous, wasteful and annoying.The only instructions are what looks like a hand-drawn diagram with little arrows drawn here and there. Not a single word printed on these two pages - where words would be extremely helpful. Apparently the folks at Lexmark don't want to *offend* anyone by writing in the language/languages spoken in the United States only, so they opt not to print any words at all. As if instructions in English might offend people! Like the United States is such a small market it's not worth their time and effort to print in English and Spanish.Other than that big annoyance though, we're both very pleased with this purchase. I'm still amazed at all the complaints - and really surprised it has only a 3.7-star review score. That's way below where it should be in my humble opinion.I have seen some reviewers say it worked well at first but after a few weeks it went bad. So, if that happens here, I'll come back and definitely adjust my score accordingly, and revise my review to let you know."

It only takes a minute once you know how to do.Hooked it up to my WiFi, reserved and assigned the IP address that it took. Real nice that it's displayed on the screen, and off we went.

The print quality is superb and it prints double sided to save paper. The printer prints fairly quietly and quickly. The best part of this color laser printer is it’s compact design. It fits in the same spot as our smaller inkjet printer. The set up was very easy as you just download the Lexmark iOS app (I use an iPhone 8 Plus) and then you just connect to your WiFi and you’re basically set up and ready for printing.

I used to have a small HP printer which was ok for my needs or what I thought it was enough for my need.

First, I was shocked at how compact this Lexmark printer is and was so surprised at the same time how powerful and fast it was, this thing is a workhorse. Specially I can send anything via WIFI and no more of running cables and tripping over them.Setup was very easy. From unpacking it, to printing my first page was about 5-10 minutes. I was also surprised at how fast it prints. The print quality was sharp, bold and clear. My only struggle was when I tried to switch from plain paper to labels, the label paper is slick on the back side and the first two sheets I tried did not want to get picked up by the coil. So, I had to take out the labels and air the sheets. What I’ve noticed is that It really helps if you keep the tray full. After doing this, printing has been a breeze.Overall, this printer has changed my mind 180 degree in favor of having a business printer. I am very happy with it, especially the speed. highly recommended."

We would like to highlight that our support team at 1-800-LEXMARK are highly skilled in these types of issues and are a wonderful resource to assist you with any future questions or issues you could experience. ,"I took a chance and got this printer based on the positive Amazon Vine reviews. The set up was a breeze, even using just the control panel and not the app. However, I tried printing a 20-page PDF that has a file size of 5mb. The printer could not process the PDF and would only print a single page and give me an error saying that the memory is full. So then I tried to just print two pages from the PDF, and it can't even handle that. If it can't print a multi-page document it is pretty worthless. And there is no way you can print 24 pages a minute if you have to print them one page at a time. If you just want to print a single page all the time, than this printer would be great for you, and the print quality was good. But if you need to print a multi-page document... you'll want to look somewhere else. Needless to say, I will be returning this and buying another HP or Brother printer.Update #1 - I spent a whole day trying to get this printer to work. I reinstalled it multiple times, restored factory settings, reset it up, updated the printer firmware, updated my operating system, and then finally figured out that if I installed it using generic post script printing and boom! it works. There was zero support on the Lexmark website. So they lose a star for that."

I was required to download an app from Lexmark to just connect my phone and printer. Then I was able to use that app to connect the printer and my internet. Once that was completed I was able to connect to it with the laptop. To print from my phone, it looks like another app is needed.I did to a test print and it seems to be working.

R2D8D7FIKARD1S,"August 7, 2019",optimummind,Vine Customer,4,C3224dw,N/A,1,0,No,Good-value color laser printer with inconsistent wake-up printing time.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D8D7FIKARD1S?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"=== My Take ===The Lexmark C3224dw is my first ever color laser printer and I like it very much for the most part. I like its compact and space-saving design and dimensions despite its heavier than expected heft. The control panel screen is bright & clear and the buttons around it are very responsive to my inputs. It is very intuitive to operate even without consulting the user manual first.I also liked its print quality - both in color and black & white. Text and images came out clear and smudge-free and the printing speed was satisfactory. Print operations were quiet, even the warm-up routine. Intermittently, however, the printer took an unusually long time to wake up from its Sleep & Hibernate status. There were times when we waited for longer than 30 seconds before the printer began flashing its light & started to print. Once it got warmed up, though, all later printer jobs printed at normal and satisfactory speeds.Another strong point for the C3224dw is its fast and simple setup process. I added it to my home network using just the control panel buttons to select my home WiFi and typing in the password. This process was seamless and very smooth. I also connected the printer to my desktop via a USB Type B cable (not included in the box) and installed the printer by installing the driver package from the Lexmark website. You also have the option to set it up using an Ethernet cable (also not included).Despite easily adding the printer to my home WiFi, however, none of my Windows 10 laptops around the house could find the printer during an actual print job, such as from Microsoft Word and Chrome browser. My wifey, who is not very techy, got frustrated because the printer wasn't listed in the printer selection drop-down menu. I had to go to Settings in Windows 10 and add the printer manually by typing in its IP address on each of my laptops. Compared to my other printers from Brother and HP, this part of my printing experience was subpar and disappointing. I expected a big printer company such as Lexmark to do a better job integrating the C3224dw to Windows 10.Another surprising thing was that there was no Windows 10 Lexmark app for the C3224dw printer. In order to access its settings, I had to launch the Embedded Web Server by opening a browser such as Chrome and then typing in its IP address. I guess some people might prefer this approach because it is one less app you have to install but I wouldn't have minded a Windows 10 app. You can install the Lexmark phone app but I chose not to do so because I have too many apps installed already on my Galaxy S10+ (>200).Once you access the printer settings via the Embedded Web Server, things are pretty straightforward and easy to navigate within. There are two main settings categories - Status & Settings. Under Status, you can view any Alerts & Warnings messages, Supply/Toner status, and printer info (firmware version, paper bin status).Under Settings, there are six additional sub-categories: Device, Print, Paper, Network/Ports, Security, and Reports.Under the Device section, I found the following options to be useful for our home - setting up low printer supply email notifications, configuring Sleep & Hibernate timeouts, turning on Eco Mode, and performing a firmware update.Inside the Print section, I turned on Duplex printing & the Collate option and set image printing to ""Auto Fit.""Inside the Network/Ports section, I left alone all the numerous options at their default (Wireless, AirPrint, Ethernet, TCP/IP, SNMP, IPSec, 802.1x, LPD, HTTP/FTP, USB, Restrict external network access, WiFi Direct) but did activate Google Cloud Print.I also left everything at default in the Security sub-section.Although the Settings page is plain and simple-looking, navigation among the options was quick, responsive, and very satisfactory and I appreciated all options given to me.All in all, I'm happy & satisfied with the Lexmark C3224dw and I don't regret getting it. Hopefully future firmware updates will improve printer wakeup time from its Sleep/Hibernate status._____*Pros:-Easy setup (WiFi or USB Type B).-Control panel buttons are responsive and intuitive to use.-Both color and black & white prints come out nice and clear.-Compact footprint.-Quiet operation.-Supports Lexmark Mobile Print, Google Cloud Print, Mopria Print, Apple AirPrint, and Wifi Direct.-Settings page offer numerous fine-tuning, network, and security options._____*Neutral:-Pretty heavy~!!-Wake-up time from Sleep is longer than I prefer.-Printer didn't get auto-detected by Windows 10 on all of my laptops on my home network. I had to add it manually by entering its IP address.-Performing a firmware update over the Embedded Web Server isn't as easy & simple as doing it with a Windows 10 or smartphone app.-Cartridge replacements will cost around $300 for all four._____*Cons:-Once in a while, print jobs over WiFi took TOO long. Inconsistent response times."
R172RBFMX6BYAL,"August 6, 2019",Nan W.,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,3,0,No,So Easy to Set Up,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R172RBFMX6BYAL?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"To set up this laser printer. Initially I thought I was not going to be able to do it and would have to get help. Then after looking at it sitting in my kitchen I decided to try. The hardest part was preparing the printer. Removing the covers on the ink, easy. Removing all the tape, easy. Finding copy paper and loading the tray, easy. Now turning it on, easy. Following the instructions, easy. Still waiting for the hard part.. found a picture to test print. My iPad found the printer and picture was printed. Can it be any easier, I don’t think so. I wish I could discuss the specs and other technical information but this lady isn’t knowledgeable. All I know is the printer was easy to setup and printed a great picture."
R1I0G70F6ZF1SI,"July 31, 2019",Dale,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,10,0,No,"Well, it has a lot to live up to. So far so good...",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I0G70F6ZF1SI?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"I am using this to replace a Brother laser printer (NO COLOR, NO WIFI) that I have used for 6 years and it was still going strong.So far I don’t regret the upgrade to this Lexmark. While it’s no faster to print than the Brother, it isn’t slower, and is MUCH quieter, which I like in my office setting. Print quality on the whole is excellent. As far as the color printing goes (which I don’t do much of), it looks good, but not great. You won’t confuse it for a photo printer, nor is it intended to be. For color documents, it’s MINT!What I don’t like...well, set up was sort of annoying. The machine prompts you to download the app on your phone, which I did. No matter what I couldn’t get the thing to connect. So I wound up backing out of the set up and doing it manually from the printer. Took forever punching in my cryptic WiFi password with no keyboard. After that, I did get a strange error about the Cyan cartridge. I cleared it and it hasn’t come back, so we will see.Overall it’s well made, has a good “heft” to it. It occupies only about the same space as my old B&W printer, which is impressive. Servicing and toner replacement is easy. It has a lot going for it, and so far I am thrilled with it!***3+ month update**** printer has been perfect. I use it every day and have not had a single paper jam or any other issues. This is a nice printer! Continues to impress!!"
R31BL20KZA0QSQ,"July 29, 2019",Ugh,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,3,0,No,A little clunky setup at first but great quality prints,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BL20KZA0QSQ?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Printers can be hit-and-miss when it comes to setting them up and this one is no different. Upon powering up, the screen prompts you to approve several settings before eventually reaching a point where you'll continue via Lexmark's mobile app, or, continue with setting up on the printer directly. I opted to go to mobile app route since I'd be connecting to my wi-fi network and entering a password on the printer's minimalist screen would be a pain.On the mobile app, you'll be prompted to connect to a wi-fi signal being output by the printer, and from there you'll tell it what wi-fi network you want IT to connect to, along with the password, and you're set!...or rather...you should be. For me, everything appeared to be setup just fine, but for some reason, I still had to manually select a network and enter the password on the printer itself. Not really sure what went wrong, but that was a little annoying. Once connected, simply install the printer's driver software from the included disc (or download from Lexmark site) and you should be set.Besides that minor inconvenience, printing quality is perfect, and fast. It goes to sleep automatically after a period of not being used, and it doesn't make any noise or mechanical adjustments when being turned on/off, or when sleeping, or being woken. Other printers I've had all seem to make noise when doing this and this sometimes occurred in the middle of the night too, so it'd be a bit startling, but this Lexmark is perfectly quiet in this respect.Overall, really nice printer that does its job well."
RYLHERBWWYBU8,"July 28, 2019",MWCraft,Vine Customer,5,C3224dw,N/A,18,0,No,Excellent Output; Easy Local or WIFI Setup,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYLHERBWWYBU8?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Below are my thoughts/observations on the Lexmark C3224dw Color Laser Printer. Some pictures are also included.Setup- the printer box had illustrations on top showing how to remove the printer from the box. I found that helpful and accurate in how best to begin the setup process.- Inside, a two sided sheet showed additional instructions for removing the tape, setting up the toner cartridges (which were already installed) and adding paper- It came with an installation CD for use in setting the printer up as locally attached to a PC. - You will need to supply your own USB printer cord and connect it to the printer and PC. - Turn on the printer; load the CD in your computer’s drive and the install process will begin automatically (I installed it on a Windows 10 desktop). In a couple of minutes, my PC sent a pop-up message that it was done.- While the CD was installing the printer drivers, etc. to my PC, the printer itself also displayed messages on its display screen: - First, it asked if I wanted to setup the phone app. I declined this since I did not want another phone app. - Next, it walked me through the steps to set it up on my home WIFI. This was pretty easy to do but unavoidably repetitive. I.e., if your WIFI name is “KatManDu-74”, you will have to enter each upper/lowercase letter, character or number by repeatedly pressing an arrow key for each one then hitting “OK”. Not difficult to do but boring. This, of course, took longer to complete than the automated process with the CD.Output QualtiyIt is excellent. I printed multiple photographs and they looked great and also printed some test prints and plain text documents that also looked really good.Printing Through WIFIWithout installing any apps to my iPhone or iPad, I was able to print multiple photos even though the WIF router was upstairs and I was in the basement sitting next to the printer. This means the image was transmitted through the floor/walls to the router and back through the floor/walls to the printer without issue.Overall ImpressionsAs stated earlier, I did not install or test any Lexmark printing apps (for the phone or PC) but do not think they are needed for wireless/remote printing. They may have other features (low toner warnings, etc.) that you may desire so, that is a choice you must make..It is quiet, and gives excellent quality output whether locally attached to your PC or sitting as a standalone device on your WIFI. You also have the option of connecting it to your network using an Ethernet cable but I did not test that since making the WIFI connection was so simple.I am very happy with the Lexmark C224DW printer."

It was very fast and got my job done in five minutes. The printer also synced with my windows system fast and simply. The printer how ever is very heavy and I needed help carrying it.
