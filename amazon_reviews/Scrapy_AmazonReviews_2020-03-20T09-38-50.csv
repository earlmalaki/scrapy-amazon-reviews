ERRORS ALL THE TIME, WE GOT TWO, BOTH HAD THE SAME ISSUE",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NRYMXAR9G1I9?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"Can't even get to try out a print.. ""REMOVE CARTRIDGE PACKAGING"" Lexmark failed, the doors don't even close properly."
R12R4GJFF35RYO,"March 13, 2020",Raleigh Araga,Verified Purchase,2,C3224dw,N/A,0,0,No,"Great quality, bad connection problems.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R12R4GJFF35RYO?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"The printer itself is pretty good. It prints great colored prints, not necessarily top grade for photographers, but sufficient enough for everyday-use colored fliers and portraits. After reading the other reviews, I thought I wouldn't have any issues with connections and that the other buyers complaining of connection issues were isolated incidents; I was wrong. What good is a printer that prints excellent pictures but constantly disconnects from your devices when you need it?! It was constantly offline. I decided to return and go with a more reliable Canon."

R2JVYG5FC41HPF,"March 9, 2020",pandafam,Verified Purchase,5,C3224dw,N/A,1,0,No,"Set up okay, print quality is amazing!",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JVYG5FC41HPF?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,"I tried another brand before this and was an awful experience printing and trying to return it. I researched and decided to go with this laser printer, and at this price point, I am shocked that the print is THIS clean and sharp. The printer is a bit heavy (~30 lbs?) and large. The set up is pretty easy - I did NOT set up through the app, I did it directly on the printer and got a bit frustrated trying to scroll type my way through my wifi password one letter at a time, but was ready to go immediately after I connected. Then I added the printer on the computer and was printing within a minute. I have also added the app on my phone but have yet to try and print off the app.The only thing I am a bit disappointed by is the darkening of colors when I print in color. Beige turns into a greenish brown, the light pink turns into a muted, darker pink. I will be mindful when printing my own creations to pick lighter colors, but am a bit puzzled by this. Not enough to send back because the printer is so quick and sharp, but a bit annoyed my colors on the screen won't come out on the page exactly. I hope this review helps someone."

R1V04ABSSB750R,"March 5, 2020",Topcop,Verified Purchase,1,C3224dw,N/A,1,0,No,Don’t Buy - WIFI Doesn’t Connect - Be ware!!,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V04ABSSB750R?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,,DO NOT buy this printer! I spent 2 1/2 hours attempting to get it to connect wirelessly. It would work intermittently but would not stay connected and I have outstanding WiFi speed & connection strength.I tried to call customer service and waited 1 hour on hold.If you are an IT guy you MIGHT be able to get this to work but for the average Joe - forget it!
R1HTSK6SKZWX1C,"March 4, 2020",Smoke92,Verified Purchase,1,C3224dw,N/A,0,1,Yes,"Garbage product, garbage tech support.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HTSK6SKZWX1C?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T6PGM4J,Thank you for this feedback. Lexmark strives to deliver quality products that are easy to use and we are disappointed we did not deliver in this case. Lexmark support calls are typically answered in under a minute when you call 1-800-LEXMARK (1-800-539-6275) from Monday-Friday 8:00am to 9:00pm EST. I hope you will give us another chance to help resolve the Wi-Fi and other issues you are having with your C3224 printer. ,"Out of the box this wouldn't work with my wi-fi connection that all my other devices work with. I ended up having to run a 20 foot USB cable to it and it still never worked. Just printed page after page of random letters, numbers, and symbols. No response on the front panel, cant even turn it off without unplugging it. Downloaded all drivers for it and no difference. Waited over an hour on the phone for technical support on multiple occasions before giving up. Lexmark chat tech support doesn't even load when you try and use it. It just says there is an error with the application. I have about 6 hours into this thing and its never worked. Don't waste your time."

For the price I wasn't expecting much, but this printer just isn't fit for any use. I got about five weeks of printing b&w documents out of it at a rate of 5-10 pages per day, 5 days per week. Very disappointing, and a waste of time, money and energy."

It does have a little troubled duplexing card stock, but at this price point I'll manually flip the page over. Only the second day, so I'll revisit this on day 30"
